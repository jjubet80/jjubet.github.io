				<p id="discuss1"><strong> Discussion Topic: Discuss why Cyber Security is now a global issue and why it is important for companies to invest in
				Cyber Security</strong><br><br>
				<strong>Initial Post</strong><br></p>
				<p>The evolving technology in the financial sector is now commonly known as FINTECH (Financial Technology). There is also,
				the traditional banking systems learning to accommodate financial technology hence, modifying its services to suit
				financial technology with new products as internet banking, ATM and digital currencies all relying on inter-connectivity
				(Dapp, T., Slomka, L., AG, D.B. and Hoffmann, R., 2015). The financial technology sector is evolving faster than the
				conventional banking as it incorporates the internet of things, connecting the telecommunication networks, computing and
				internet. There is also a growing interaction between the new financial technology companies and the existing
				traditional banks in terms of data exchange. These data exchanges amidst differing technological adaptations often lead
				to inconsistencies. These inconsistencies could also expose both the fintech institutions and the traditional banks to
				significant privacy issues, data breaches and cyber attacks (Najaf, K., Mostafiz, M.I. and Najaf, R., 2021). In 2016,
				the cyber security experts of Nigeria CSEAN, estimated that Nigeria for example, loses 127 billion naira annually to
				cyber attack. with the emergence of financial technology and digital businesses the figure is bound to triple (Faya, M.
				and Ogbuefi, N., 2019)<br><br>
				Financial technology has disrupted the banking process with an attendant increased in Cyber crime. Financial information
				is of high value target for many cyber criminals and Fintech firms have increasingly become attractive targets and
				typically, have fewer resources dedicated to cyber security. (Faya .M. And Ogbuefi .N.). In India, about 4800 computers
				were reported to be attacked by the wannacry ransomware which revealed that the attack was possible based on a weak
				Windows XP and unpatched Windows operating systems used by about 70% of the country's ATMs operating systems. It also
				stated that data of about 3.2 million debit cards was lost in what is claimed to the India's biggest breaches. SBI, HDFC
				Bank, ICICI, YES Bank and Axis were all hit by the breach of debit cards. Cyber attacks cost Indian businesses about $4
				Billion every year as per latest estimates(Kumar, A., 2021). Furthermore, With the emergence of covid-19 pandemic and
				social distancing protocols, where people tend to live in isolation, there is an increased dependence on digital
				financial services (Alber, N. and Dabour, M., 2020).<br><br>
				India launched an Interface for Money mobile application (BHIM), which was downloaded 17 Million times within two months
				of launch. Also, PayTM, India's leading mobile payments service crossed the 200 Million users mark earlier this year,
				and have most recently launched PayTM bank with about $1.4 Billion raised from Softbank valuing the firm at $7 Billion
				(Kumar, A., 2021). These huge investments in FINTECH, needs to be securely guarded as cyber attacks on these platforms
				can be catastrophic. Regulators would also have to enact policies and regulation to ensure adequate level of cyber
				security and data privacy (Faya .M. And Ogbuefi .N.). Regulatory authorities have to respond quickly to the requirements
				for the stability of the financial system in the light of the of growth of digital payment sector, especially the ones
				resulting from FinTech (Alber, N. and Dabour, M., 2020)<br><br>
				The rapid growth in financial technology presents a risk of cyber attacks, security and privacy breaches hence the need
				to protect customer data and privacy in a similar matching approach. The cybersecurity market is expected to grow from
				USD 152.71 billion in 2018 to USD248.26 billion by 2023, at a Compound Annual Growth Rate of 10.2% during 2018–2023
				(Adeyoju, A., 2019). Cyber security is therefore concluded a necessity in the present world global economy and therefore
				deserves the appropriate funding and attention to avert a global economic crisis in the financial industry.<br><br>

				Post by Nkosana Mlambo<br>
				Hi Jurbe, thank you for the enlightenment as I’m not quite familiar with the financial industry. One pattern I see is
				that these challenges are not only faced by the financial industry but across other industries as well. There is a rapid
				growth in technology in every sector which changes how companies operate, in contrast, the landscape for cyber-crime
				activities also expands continuously. There is a dire need for cyber security professionals and advanced controls to
				tackle these challenges and keep up with the shortage gap as cyber criminals are also advancing day-by-day. It is quite
				scary to think that you’ll find bank teller machines operating on window XP operating systems and still have unpatched
				machines on critical systems. There is most definitely no place for legacy systems today to be operated on open
				networks. What would you think is the biggest cyber security challenge in the financial sector, would it be just a
				funding or prioritization issue, lack of cyber security professionals, inadequate controls or poor infrastructure, etc?<br><br>
				Response from Jurbe Jubet to Nkosana Mlambo<br>
				Hi Nkosana,<br>
				Thank you for your response. It was so thoughtful of you to have brought this up. Let me summaries it. Coincidentally, I
				read another post in this discussion by Mohamed Danialou and I will quote it here, “As more businesses are joining the
				digitization race in order to survive, cybersecurity has been left trailing behind with businesses ill-equipped to
				assess the risks of exposing critical business data and assets to a global audience without implementing adequate
				security controls”. This I want to believe, is a major factor that has created the biggest cyber security challenge in
				the financial sector. There is the general competitive advantage of joining the digital race for most financial service
				providers especially as majority of the new financial service providers (Fintech) use internet technologies. There is
				also the factor of cost cutting where it appears to be cheaper using technology (Internet banking, ATM) to provide
				services other than human beings or the brick-and-mortar physical branch banking. Unfortunately, these cost cutting
				measures as well as the competitive drive has left cyber security trailing behind, since this will require additional
				spending, also with a mindset that there are no longer lives and properties to protect in a digitised environment. It
				can be inferred that consequently, other factors such as prioritization issue, lack of cyber security professionals,
				inadequate controls, or poor infrastructure, interrelate with this factor
			</p>
				<h5 id="summary1">Summary Post</h5>
				<p>The Fintech(Financial Technology) company is experiencing rapid growth in recent years accelerated by technological
				drivers such as Internet of things, cloud technology and Covid 19. They incorporate mobile Technology to offer financial
				services(Mobile Money) however, its customers have become vulnerable to Cyber crime due to poor user education
				(Paintsil, 2021).<br><br>
				Subramaniam (2021), further noted that the Fintech companies utilize more internet facilities to offer financial
				services and generate more data traffic which therefore entails the need for additional security to match their appetite
				for effective service delivery<br><br>
				Mlambo (2021), Following these discussions, noted the rapid growth in cyber-crime across all other sectors and
				highlighted the need for cyber security professionals to match the changing landscape for cyber-crime activities which
				is also growing at the same pace. His approach is to identify the challenges that might be facing the financial sector
				in a bid to fight Cyber Crime.<br><br>
				Tolofari (2021) identified challenges to Cyber security and the need for trained personnel especially in the aspect of
				Cryptography, monitoring and configuration since Cyber-attacks can be carried out in any location.<br><br>
				The discussions were both informative and educative. They all highlighted the importance of Cyber security to the
				growing financial sector. I totally agree with the submissions made by my colleagues identifying that Fintechs need to
				adopt new technology and shun legacy systems, educate their users on cybercrime incidences to build trust, invest more
				in Cyber security to match their appetite for effective service delivery, employ new ways of securing data using
				cryptography and stratify transaction modes such that huge transactions are only done in more secured platforms. Based
				on these outcomes, it can be concluded that Cyber security has a software, hardware, and a human component (Brookshear &
				Brylow 2020). It is as important as protecting life and properties

			<p>Network security will presumably become more complex even as more organizations expand their internal networks and
			others are joining the internet. There are over 5,168,780,607 internet users in the world as of 31st March 2021 as
			against 16 million in 1995 (Internet World Stats, 2019). The complexity in network security can also be exacerbated by
			the rise in cybercrime in recent years. Controlling network access and placing restrictions can prevent security issues.<br><br>
			The Network Access Control (NAC) is a useful security tool as networks expand both internally and externally. This
			method of security is designed to give access to specified resources, and a defined set of users or devices. Access
			control identifies confidentiality, and then defines its availability, by granting access only to authorized
			users/networks, thereby ensuring network information integrity. A NAC system can deny network access to noncompliant
			devices, place them in a quarantined area, or give them only restricted access to computing resources, thus keeping
			insecure nodes from infecting the network (Saleh, M.F., 2011). The Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) which manages
			Cisco’s NAC, also extends trust and network visibility to the cloud technology (Cisco, N.D). While NAC can be employed
			as a security solution over the network, this has a limitation because it only focuses on controlling access to
			networks. it is effective for protecting against threats that are external to a network. It does not detect breaches
			after they occur or protect against “insider” threats that originate on an already-authenticated device (Order, 2021).
			Other security solutions will therefore be required along side this method for a more reliable network protection<br><br>
			Another network security solution that can be relied upon for internal security, and an extension to NAC is the stateful
			inspection firewall. A stateful inspection firewall verifies and keeps track of established connections, performs data
			packet inspection. It maintains a state table with source IP, destination IP, source port and destination port for a
			securely established connection. Stateful inspection firewalls works with the TCP handshake checking for legitimate
			connections as well as source and destination IPs to determine which data packets can pass through (Bonuccelli, 2020).
			The Linux iptables firewall technology is an open-source firewall which maintains iptables configured to define if a
			traffic is legitimate to flow from source to destination. (Mihalos, et al 2019). Although these extra checks provide
			advanced security, they consume a lot of system resources and can slow down traffic considerably. Hence, they are prone
			to DDoS (distributed denial-of-service attacks) (Bonuccelli, 2020). A splay tree filter or skip list can however be
			incorporated to classify and prioritize inspection packets, thereby accelerating the processing time (Khezrian & Abbasi,
			2019).<br><br>
			A combination of different security technologies may be used for a more secured system. Security issues keep changing
			landscapes as cyber criminals’ device new means of attacking systems. A manipulation can occur that might render the
			current security systems ineffective hence, from another perspective, while securing the network is very important,
			emphasis can also be made on system resilience in the event of unknown form of attack. The challenges to Network
			security are enormous and perhaps the perspective of securing the network should also have a component of offence to
			deter cybercrime since the repercussions of attacking an offensive network could have devastating effect on the
			cybercriminal.<br><br>

		<p>Peer response to Abidemi Adelakun<br>
		Hi Abidemi, A commendable feature of the Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) is its passive state which can work
		without interfering with the network traffic which they monitor<br>
		
		The NIDS in this state sniffs the internal interface of the firewall in read-only mode and sends alerts to a management
		server or an administrator via a different network interface.<br>
		
		Although this may come as a disadvantage as real threats can be missed, (False Negatives) since it does not strip off
		data packets to inspect potential threats in the packets, this feature of packet sniffing comes in handy in monitoring
		compliance and logging of events.<br>
		
		These events can be used to analyse security systems or implement more effective controls. The feature also generates
		false positives, but this can be fine-tuned based the organisations appetite<br><br>
		Peer response to Sherelle Garwood<br>
		Hi Sherelle, thank you. That was an interesting read<br>
		
		As you rightly mentioned, the Human factor is a prominent factor in cyber security and this is also one major reason why
		Insider threats are difficult to curtail<br>
		
		User behavioral analysis(UBA) will be a great tool for insider threats since the staff behaviors can be monitored to
		establish what is considered normal behavior or abnormal behavior This analysis may be based of a certain class/set of
		users or based on a user daily routine. It uses machine learning techniques to weigh the factors and, if the deviation
		looks significant, issues an alert. If a user is assigned new responsibilities, the system needs to take them into
		account and establish a new baseline<br>
		
		Although behavioral analysis might indicate suspicious activities among users, there is also the concern that these
		suspicious activities might not be properly interpreted without a sound understanding of the human psychology.
		Sometimes, people can do unusual things for legitimate reasons (Miller, 2020). Employee risk profiles can differ and can
		be complex. Certain negative emotions, stressors, and conflicts have long been associated with incidents of workplace
		aggression, employee turnover, absenteeism, accidents, fraud, sabotage, and espionage (Stroz et al.,2016). User
		Behavioral analysis is therefore quite complex and may require a factor of the human psychology incorporated into its
		security Architecture or framework.<br><br>
		Peer response to Bee Teck Ivan Chua<br>
		Thank you, Bee.<br>
		This is an interesting piece and quite practical. As you mentioned, the water treatment plant has two
		networks separated by a physical firewall. My attention was drawn to the advantage of this physical firewall and its
		implication to this security arrangement. The physical firewall is a hardware standalone device having its own
		resources, CPU, RAM, Disk space and operating software making it a robust solution for large networks. It doesn’t have
		to depend on shared resources like the software firewall (Konikiewicz and Markowski, 2017).<br>
		
		This arrangement shows that the operation network has no direct interface with the outside network and is again,
		protected by another physical firewall which separates it from the office network. The operation network which requires
		more protection, is hidden from the outside network therefore, the attack surface has been minimized. Insider threats
		have also been minimized by access granted to designated ports or url.<br>
		
		As you mentioned, the cost is higher and the setup and configuration are more complicated, however, the benefit will far
		outweigh this disadvantage in the long run considering the implication of a cyber-attack like ransomware attack, which
		can run into billions (Stu Sjouwerman, July 29, 2021). Also worth considering, is that some physical firewalls that come
		with proprietary operating systems, offer a great security advantage over general operating systems which might have
		security vulnerabilities that can be exploited by hackers (Upadhyay, 2020)<br>
		
		Interestingly also, is the interoperability for the physical firewall allowing it to run a VPN connection. This brings
		in other security forms to the network and enables the provision of access to authorized users even when they are not
		physically present and in this scenario, it was also used as a remote troubleshooting tool.<br>
		
		However, I am a bit worried about the effectiveness of this security setup against DDoS attack since a successful attack
		on the Office network means there may be ineffective monitoring of the PLC system. What do you think Bee?<br><br>
