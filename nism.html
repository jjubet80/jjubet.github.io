						<h4>Reflections</h4>
						<p><strong>Reflection on NISM module</strong><br><br>

							This module focused on Network and Information Security Management. There were alot of practical activities and discussion forums in this module which focused basically on network vulnerability identification, penetration testing, data breaches and protection and network security management<br><br>
							
							There were teams set up for most of the practical Exercises performed. I was part of the group 2 which comprised of Elizabeth Cook, Isioma Vina Tolofari, Samuel Osoradion Tolofari and Myself. There were other groups 1 and 3. In the first group meeting, we asked Elizabeth Cook to lead the group since we wanted a coordinated activity.<br><br>
							
							The first Exercise was a discussion forum in Unit 1 of the module that highlight the vulnerabilities in a medical training Mannequin exploited using Brute force attacks and Denial of Service attack.<br><br>
							
							The second Exercise was a group Exercise on STRIDE & DREAD tools presented in Seminar 1. STRIDE is a threat model technique developed by Microsoft and stands for Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Elevation of Privilege while DREAD is a risk assessment tool to help measure the risk of the threats identified. DREAD stands for Damage, Reproducibility, Exploitability, Affected Users and Discoverability. The compromised medical mannequin in Unit 1 was the topic used to evaluate STRIDE and DREAD.<br><br>
							
							The Third Exercise was a Team activity. The team was tasked with a practical Scanning Exercise in Unit 3 to use available tools like traceroute and whois to find administrative information on an allocated website allmytype.ac.uk. A discussion forum set up to discuss the results for each group.<br><br>
							
							A seminar was done on Would the Internet we have today be much better if it was based on the ISO/ OSI 7-layer model rather than TCP/IP? And in the discussion, I submited my opinion that the internet is better with the OSI model since it has more elaborate layers and seems to have more focus on security. Other Teams also submitted similar views in support of the OSI.<br><br>
							
							Another interesting Team exercise was the design document submitted in Unit 6 and 11. we identified governing bodies for the website allocated (blog site allmytype.ac.uk), possible security vulnerabilities and mitigation. In Unit 8 we also reviewed the standard applicable to the website which is GDPR.<br><br> 
							
							My research on vulnerabilities was basically based on the OWASP top 10 website vulnerabilities. This is because OWASP is a non profit organization with decades of experience and whose aim is to research was on improving web site security(Imperva.com, N.D).<br><br>
							
							There was a discussion forum on GDPR related case studies. I chose a case study relating to missing evidence and highlighted the implication as a breach of the GDPR Art 32.  Breach checklist was also prepared and presented at a seminar<br><br>
							
							Unit 11 also highlighted several future trends in the internet in which our group discussed the peer-to-peer overlay-based networking as a future trend. This was a group Exercise. Each member presented his argument and it is clear that the trend tends to address certain deficiencies of the current system architectures.<br><br>
							
							The scanning exercise in Unit 3 was quite interesting as there were some arguments on the exact location of the A2hosting web servers. Group 1 team noted that the server was located at Amsterdam while my group noted that it was located at USA. It was quite an interesting exercise that gave me an indept knowledge of a scanning Exercise. With the Experience I now have, I would say that it is quite challenging to determine the physical location of these devices especially with the advent of technologies like software defined networks (SDN) and virtual technologies<br><br>
							
							The discussion on medical mannequin compromise made me realize that so many IoT devices where design with capabilities to connect to the Internet without considering the inherent danger of cyber attacks. The need for secured systems in this modern day cannot be over emphasized especially with medical equipment since these may endanger human life.<br><br>
							
							
							After reading other data breach case studies from some of my colleagues, I was particularly worried at the level of negligence to data privacy. One case that baffled me was that which was posted by Vina Tolofari of a situation were a delay Tactics was used to deny access to a CCTV footage on the ground of loss of data due to retention policy. In my opinion, this shows that the GDPR regulations are greatly undermined and privacy issue are not taken seriously. Perhaps, more stringent sanctions or a review of the GDPR regulations will change the narrative.<br><br>
							
							The discussion forums have been very Engaging. I realise its not just about writing what you know. There is alot of critically in those discussion forums and alot of research has to be done. The feeling that what I am writing may not make a logical sense to my other colleagues, make me want to explore more ideas and scrutinize my submissions in the forums.<br><br>
							
							
							The breach checklist prepared as a group exercise in UNIT 10 is a very useful tool since it maps out important requirements and steps to monitor compliance to the GDPR data breach policy. What I also think is necessary is regular training on completing this breach checklist using different scenarios will expose data processors on how to effectively use this breach checklist<br><br>
							
							For the STRIDE & DREAD tools, I have a little reservation to the STRIDE threat modelling because it is quite and old technique and with the changing landscape in cyber attacks and rapidly emerging threats, I am not comfortable adopting it as a threat modelling Technique. The DREAD analysis also appears to be a concern to me because while we were deliberating as a group on how we access the risk, I became conscious of the possibility of these ratings to be subjective and also immature. I wasn’t too comfortable with the ratings because I felt I might have a different opinion at the end of the course after I have mastered the course and learned other aspects of Risk.<br><br>
							
							The module was full of practical activities which I must admit there was a little bit of inexperience in this kind of activity however, I am certain that performing this kind of activity over and over again will eventually make me outstanding. This is the kind of activity I like as I prefer more practical activities than theoretical exercise.<br><br>

				<h3 id="top">Unit 1: Network and Information Security Management: History & Definitions</h3>
				<p>This module is on information security management; history and definitions. the module also focused on the standards in information security and how they affect cyber security.The origin of computer security can be traced back to the time of compatible timesharing system where multiple users could access a system and also see others passwords. information security management is based upon 4 concepts; Confidentiality, Integrity,  availability and No-repudiation. Confidentiality is talking about disclosure to unauthorised individuals or entities.  it talks about how information should be guarded, who needs a particular information and who should be restricted, what is the implication of this information getting into the wrong hands. Integrity talks about how accurate the information is, how is this information important, how should the information be categorised. Availability is about how the information could be access, how can it be used. Non repudiation is about the ability to track an event, the ability to know when an event has  happen to be able to prove when and how it hapened.<br>
					Threat and vulnerabilities were discussed. A threat is any unwanted incident that can potentially harm a system or an organisation. vulnerability is a form of weakness to any form of asset.
					Threat modelling system known as STRIDE was developed by Microsoft categorising threats in to different forms. STRIDE stands for SPOOFING, TAMPERING, REPUDIATION, INFORMATION DISCLOSURE, DENIAL OF SERVICE ELEVATION OF PREVILEGE. spoofing is falsifying data, to gain an illegitimate advantage.Tempering is the ability of the attacker to modify data and render data in a different form. Repudiation is when an attacker can deny what has taken place. Information disclosure is when the attacker has access to confidential information. Denial of service is where legitimate users are being denied access to information. Elevation of privilege is when the attacker is able to grant himself authorised access.
					Also discussed in this unit is DREAD analysis. DREAD is a risk-assessment tool for security threats. DREAD stands for Damage, Reproduceability, Exploitability, Affected users, Discoverability. Damage assesses the extend of devastation of the attack, Reproduceability assess how easily can it spread, Exploitability asseses how simple it is to launch the attack, Affected user assessesn the users that can be affected and Discoverability assesses the ease of discovering the threat.</p> 
					<P>Also in this Unit, we were assigned to groups for a team project. details of the team project is captured in subsequent units as well as the Archive section
					The collaborative discussion forum 2 was initiated which was based on a research done by students of University of South Alabama on a health care information system. it discussed how a medical training equipment was attacked using brute force attacks and denial of service. details of the research is found in link https://aisel.aisnet.org/amcis2015/HealthIS/GeneralPresentations/5/</p>
				
				<h3 id="unit2">Unit 2: Real World Issues and Implications of Information Security Threats and Vulnerabilities.</h3>
				<p>In unit 2, we discuss real world issues and implications of information security threats and vulnerabilities. we reviewed the vulnerabilities as discussed in the unit 1 about medical equipment. There was a seminar presentation on STRIDE and DREAD tools and a Group was setup for a group Exercise. The first Exercise is to use the STRIDE and DREAD tools based on the Discussion forum on Unit 1 on compromising the Medical Mannequin using brute force attack and Denial of Service Attack. The outcome of the Team exercise is found below</p>
				<h3 id="unit3">Unit 3: Network Fundamentals</h3>
				<p>Unit 3 is about network fundamentals. Digital communication is a process of sending data over communication channel or computer bus. this can be done in a sequentially or non sequentially. number to the time or by sending several bits as a set could currently on a link with several parallel channels always both systems are still in use today although serial communication is<br>
					Different communication links exist. The Serial link and the parallel link based on the communication types. Examples of serial communication links include RS-232, USB, (both used with modems) FireWire and Ethernet. Examples of parallel communication links include PATA connections, centronics printer links and VGA connections. Parallel connections are usually limited in maximum speed limits due to issues with timing skew and or crosstalk. Unlike parallel communication links which are almost always synchronous, serial links can be synchronous or asynchronous.<br>
					Different protocols and encoding technologies are used for these communications. Basic endocding aims to achieve clock recovery, improve error detection and noise reduction and improve bandwidth throughput. Encoding types include Manchester Encoding, 8B/10B, 64B/66B AND 128/132B encoding<br>
					Communication Technologies include Circuit switching or Packet Switching. Circuit switching establishes a virtual circuit between communication points which will now guarantee a dedicated bandwidth for them to communicate through out the session. Packet Switching splits packets into small chunks or and transmits packet by packet to the end destination without any dedicated connection in between and assemble again in the correct order s. Also discussed were different digital communication techniques like multiplexers, Modem, time sharing systems, packet switched networks, ARPANET, CYCLADES, etc<br>
					The Software Defined Networking (ONF) separates the packet forwarding technology from the control technology
					The internet has evolved overtime in terms of speed, technology and number of users. Comon technologies now transmit speeds of 100gb/s, wireless networks now at 802.11ax, mobile phones now support  5G, network technologies now surfacing is the Internet of things and internet protocols like Quick UDP Internet Connections are gaining grounds<br>
					The concluding part of discussion forum on medical mannequin started in unit one was posted in this unit 3. details of the summary post is found in the archive section</p>
				<h3 id="unit4">Unit 4: Basic Network Investigation Using Standard Tools</h3>
				<p>In this unit, a practical activity was done within our group with the aim of familiaring the use of  various network troubleshooting tools like ping, traceroute (tracert), nslookup.
					A website address was given to our group to identify the some administrative information using the various trouble shooting tools available
					The results of this scanning activity was discussed in a collaborative discussion forum. The initial post highlighted the tools used and results obtained. Details of this discussion is found on the Archive section
					A seminar presentation was also done to discuss the publication, Rough Consensus and Running Code’ and the Internet-OSI Standards War. IEEE Annals of the History of Computing. Available from: https://www2.cs.duke.edu/courses/common/compsci092/papers/govern/consensus.pdf
					The discusion was centred around  “Would the Internet we have today be much better if it was based on the ISO/ OSI 7-layer model rather than TCP/IP? “
					In my opinion, the OSI layer 7 approach is a welcome initiative which I belive should cater ot the rapid expansion of the internet, the security issues associated with the internet expansion and dependence</p>
				<h3 id="unit5">Unit 5: Network Tools and Components</h3>
				<p>In this unit, we learned the various types of networks. A Local Area Network (LAN) is basically most common and similar to the home network. Laptops or desktops with ethernet connections use coaxial cable to connect. These were for many connected over a shared single cable but has now evolved into star topology. In the shared single cable network, a device will communicate to the other computers using a broadcast to every connected computer on the shared network. A communication protocol the CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense with Multiple Access and Collision Detection). Was used to detect where there is a collision and arrange for re-transmitting
					Other devices and terminologies learnt were switches, mac address, vitiual LANs,wifi networks, CSMA/CA (Carrier Sense with Multiple Access and Collision Avoidance), WEP(Wired equivalent privacy), WPA(WiFi protected Access), modulator/demodulator(Modem), ISDN(Integrated Services Digital Network), ADSL(Asymmetric Digital Subsriber Line)
					
					Wide Area Networks( WANs), connects LANs together. It forms the backbone of the internet as involves the routers that switch packets over large networks. The ISP(internet service providers) use routers that provide network to LANs or home networks. Roters have the control pane and the forwarding pane. The control pane maintains route information and the forwarding pane controls the forwarding of packet to destinations. Routers maintain routing tables which can be static or dynamic.static routing tables are manually maintained while dynamic routing table is based on algorithms and rules. It is controlled by the RIP(routing information protocol), EIGRP(Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol), OSPF(Open Shortest Path First), BGP(Border Gateway Protocol), MPLS (Multiprotocol  Label Switching). Other terminologies are  GPRS(General Packet Radio Services), GSM(Global system for Mobile Communication)
					
					Firewalls are filters usually situated at points that separates a trusted network from an untrusted network. Firewalls can be packet filtering. Identifying legitimate traffic based on the packet attributes. firewalls can used stateful inspection. They maintained an internal state table which tracked details of packets such as transport layer flags and sequence numbers. Other firewalls are application firewalls or web application firewalls (WAF) which inspect packets at higher levels of the network stack, up to the application layer. 
					Next Generation Firewall (NGFW) uses the UTM(unified Threat Management technique) to incorporate several defence mechanism into 1. the NGFW detects and blocks threats using the IPS(Intrusion prevention system), IDS(Intrusion detection system), DPI (Deep Packet Inspection), user authentication etc. Points to note when using firewalls are strong passwords other than default password, security certificates installed for all communications, efficient configuration, restriction on disabling firewalls, regular patching, review of vendor security bulletins, provision for constant power supply, effecting loggin and monitoring etc
					The history of Network Operating system was also treated. Discussing the Xerox XNS protocol, Vines and Novell netware, personal netware for peer to peer networks, windows NT, Linux etc.
					Network and virtual appliance can be categorised into Utility appliances(network attached storage, Integrated Intranet servers), security appliances(UTM, Proxy servers), Virtual appliances, CDN(Content Delivery Network) <br>

				<h3 id="unit6">Unit 6: An Evaluation of Commonly Utilised Network Scanning and Vulnerability Testing Tools</h3>
				<p>In this Unit, we performed an evaluation Exercise as part of the Team activity. We created a Team project Design document as found below.
					A seminar preparation activity was also carried out as enumerated below
					Read the blog post in preparation for this week’s seminar - “Geer, D. (2015) 8 Penetration Testing Tools That Will Do the Job. (Network World)"
					Evaluate the tools discussed therein against the criteria: ease of install, ease of use, flexibility, licensing, privacy, reputation.
					Rate each tool on a scale of 1-5, 5 being the most popular/ highest score.
					Which tool gets the highest rating according to your evaluation?
					Discuss your results with your team and be ready to discuss them in the seminar.
					The blog post (Geer, D. (2015) 8 Penetration Testing Tools That Will Do The Job. Network World.) described 8 common penetration testing tools and how to use them. 
					The Nessus Vulnerability Scanner scans for open ports and vulnerabilities it is however very noisy and scans through the front door. The Nmap scans for hosts, open ports, software versions, operating systems, hardware versions, and vulnerabilities. Burp Suite scans your web browser to map web applications, discover their functionality, security holes and launch custom attacks. One major advantage is its ability to investigate cross site scripting. The OWASP ZAP simulates, brute force attacks and fuzzing in order to identify unsecure code.  SQLmap investigates improperly coded sites and URLs attached to databases using python codes. Its useful for scanning for SQL injection vulnerabilities.  Jawfish accepts searching parametersin form a goal and modifies itself to achieve the goal. It scans for vulnerabilitiesand updating an internal database accordingly. Kali Linux is a pen testing suite. It comes with a variety of pen testing tools to achieve different results. Metasploit is the most popular pen test tool,  useful for testing a very large network.
					Below is the Assignment completed as a Team project based on the use of the Pentesting tools, STRIDE and DREAD analysis and the group allocated blog allmytype.co.uk  <br>

				<h3 id="unit7">Unit 7: Risks and Standards</h3>
				<p>This module is on Risk and Standards. A lecture was presented which touch down on 3 major areas. Risk, Business continuity and Disaster recovery and General Data Protection Regulation. 
					In other to properly evaluate risk, Security managers need to collect information from different sources and analyse risk from different perspectives. Collecting information can be in form of a risk register, gathering data from sources such as risk notification mailboxes, threat workshops, business impact assesements, gap analysis, and security audits.
					Evaluating risk entails assigning them either a numerical (quantitative) or subjective (qualitative) assessment value. Qualitative assessment can be by categorising risk into minor, medium or major. These can be assigned a numerical value later if desired. Quantitive assessments would use statistical or historical data to evaluate and assign a weighting to a risk. 
					After evaluating all the risk gathered, the next step is the decision stage where actions are considered to either tolerate the risk, eliminate the risk, reduce the risk, or transfer the risk to other forms. Mitigating actions that be employed once these decisions are taken include security guards/patrols, alarms systems and CCTV; new processes and procedures, firewalls, IDS, SIEM (security information and event management) solutions.<br><br>
					Business continuity plans and disaster recovery (BC & DR) should form part of the security Architecture. These are ways of managing risk. Business continue ensures plans are in place for minimal disruption of services in the event of an attack or failure. Disaster recovery is a subset of Business continue which ensures systematic renaissance of infrastructure in the event of an attack.<br><br>
					Several frameworks such as TOGAF (The Open Group Architecture Framework), The architecture development method (ADM)and SABSA (Sherwood Applied Business Security Architecture) are models which incorporate BC and DR.<br><br>
					There are two factors that drive the DR plan and design. The Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and The Recovery Point Objective (RPO). RTO determines how quickly the IT infrastructure needs to be recovered in the event of an incident, and RPO determines from what point the system needs to be recovered
					General Data Protection Regulation GDPR set out guidance for data protection. GDPR is based on 7 principles name:<br><br>
					Lawfulness, Fairness and Transparency.<br><br>
					Purpose Limitation (processing data only for the identified and explicit original.<br><br>
					Data Minimisation - data must be relevant and limited to what is necessary.<br><br>
					Accurate and where possible kept up to date.<br><br>
					Storage Limitation - personal data is only kept for a period consistent with the purpose it was collected for.<br><br>
					Integrity and Confidentiality, data is processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data.<br><br>
					Accountability, it is the responsibility of the controller for complying with the principles, and to have appropriate processes and records in place to demonstrate that they have complied.<br><br>
					An important regulation of the GDPR is article 5 (1) (f) which states;<br><br>
					'Processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical or organisational measures'
					Salient points in this is the Technical measures and Organisational measure.<br>
					Technical measures include assessment of the legal basis for processing, location of data, categories of data, retention schedules and staff and processor access. Also includes physical” security such as physical locks, physical access controls (locked cabinets in locked rooms for special category data) and secure paper disposal.<br><br>
					Organisational measure include staff training, policies, procedures, documentation and monitoring. Policies and procedures include Access control and Password Management, Asset Management, Business continuity, Bring Your Own Device and Remote Access, Breach Policy, Data retention and Erasure policy, Email Internet Usuage and Archive, Clear desk policy etc<br><br>
					Other standards noted where ISO 27000 family of guides and standards governing security incidence, codes of practice and people process and technology. The Payment Card Industry – Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS), NIST i.e, The National Institute of Standards and Technology, an American non-regulatory agency. The Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) . The Control Objectives for IT (COBIT) deals with emphasis on risk management, information security and compliance. The Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) is mostly concerned with service design, implementation and operations and certainly since v3 security has been an intrinsic part of that
					Also in this Unit, a scanning Exercise was done as a group Exercise based on the instruction below<br><br>
					Read Bhatt (2018) sections 4 & 5 provides an overview of some of the most commonly used tools in Kali Linux – and how to access them.<br>Further details are available from Hertzog et al (2017) - links for both these documents are in your reading list.<br>In addition, Hertzog et al (2017) gives a good overview of Kali Linux and its operating modes (i.e. whether to run it from usb, DVD or to install it – we would recommend either of the first two). Chapter 2 discusses download locations, how to verify the download, and so on.<br>
					Perform scans against your assigned website using the tools available in Kali Linux. Answer as many of the following questions as you can:<br><br>
					•	What Operating System does the web site utilise?<br>
					•	What web server software is it running?<br>
					•	Is it running a CMS (Wordpress, Drupal, etc?)<br>
					•	What protection does it have (CDN, Proxy, Firewall?)<br>
					•	Where is it hosted?<br>
					•	Does it have any open ports?<br>
					•	Does the site have any known vulnerabilities?<br>
					•	What versions of software is it using? Are these patched so that they are up to date?<br><br>
					
					Details of this excercise is in the Artifact section<br>
					This was uploaded in the Wiki entries section of the Exercise<br>
					</p>
				<h3 id="unit8">Unit 8: How to Evaluate and Apply Applicable Security Standards</h3>
				<p>This unit focuses on Regulations regarding an Assigned case study. It primarily deals with the GDPR regulation. Several case studies were presented and a discussion forum initiated with the following requirement;<br><br>
					Read the website at Data Protection Commission (2020) CaseStudies|DataProtection Commission Available from: https://dataprotection.ie/en/pre-gdpr/case-studies<br><br>
					
					There are several case studies published during years 2014 – 2018 concerning GDPR related issues and breaches. Considering the case study you have chosen answer the following questions: <br><br>
					
					What is the specific aspect of GDPR that your case study addresses? <br><br>
					How was it resolved? <br><br>
					If this was your organisation what steps would you take as an Information Security Manager to mitigate the issue? <br><br>
					Post your responses to the discussion. Your initial posting should respond to the question and be at least 200 words long. The initial post should be labelled ‘Initial Post’. <br><br>
					
					You should demonstrate that you understand the topic covered and ensure you use references to academic literature (journals, books, reports, etc.). This activity will provide evidence of your personal growth and your summary post is required in your e-portfolio. <br><br>
					
					Identify and analyse security risks and vulnerabilities in IT network systems and determine appropriate methodologies, tools and techniques to manage and/or solve them. <br><br>
					Design and critically appraise computer programs and systems to produce solutions that help manage and audit risk and security issues. <br><br>
					Gather and synthesise information from multiple sources (including Internet security alerts and warning sites) to aid in the systematic analysis of security breaches and issues. <br><br>
					Articulate the legal, social, ethical and professional issues faced by information security professionals<br><br>
					I selected that case study on <b>Loss of sensitive personal data contained in an evidence file kept by An Garda Síochána</b> available from the link https://www.dataprotection.ie/en/pre-gdpr/case-studies#201703<br><br>
					<b>Details of this discussion is available the Aritifact section for collaborative discussion</b><br><br>
					The seminar 4 preparation Excercise on Security Standards was also completed and details can be found on the Artefact section; <br><br>
					The preparation Exercise:Review the following links/ websites and answer the questions below. <br><br>
					
					ICO (2020) Guide to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
					
					PCI Security Standards.org (2020) Official PCI Security Standards Council Site - PCI Security Standards Overview. <br><br>
					
					HIPAA (2020) HIPAA For Dummies – HIPAA Guide. <br><br>
					
					Which of the standards discussed in the sources above would apply to the website/ organisation assigned to you for the assessment? For example, a company providing services to anyone living in Europe or a European-based company or public body would most likely be subject to GDPR. A company handling online payments would most likely need to meet PCI-DSS standards. <br><br>
					Evaluate your assigned website against the appropriate standards and decide how you would check if standards were being met? <br><br>
					What would your recommendations be to meet those standards?
					What assumptions have you made? <br><br>
					We will be discussing these articles and the wiki in this week’s seminar. After the seminar, review your initial response in this Unit's Collaborative Discussion (3) as well as those of your colleagues. There will also be an opportunity to review your team’s progress during the seminar. <br><br>

				<h3 id="unit9">Unit 9: System Logging and Forensics</h3>
				<p>This unit focused on System Logging and Forensic. A lecture was presented which discussed the importants of system logging and forensics. Topic discussed were Logs, security Breaches and Digital Forensics<br><br>
					A definition of logs was given as that which was stated by  NIST. <br><br>
					“A log is a record of the events occurring within an organization’s systems and networks. Logs are composed of log entries; each entry contains information related to a specific event that has occurred within a system or network” <br><br>
					It is important to keep track of events as they are hapening as this will help identify and rectify issues when things go wrong. Security systems rely on Logs. There are different types of Logs. <br><br>
					The syslog  system is a part of the core system logging on the BSD, Linux operating system.In this system, the logs are store in the /var/log directory. The logs are categorised based on their functions. Logs for system mails, boot up messages, mail servers meassages,kernel messages, device driver loggs, Loggins and Authentication attempts, web servers and database logs etc<br><br>
					UNIX system use the Logrotate which are stored in the /etc/logrotate.conf file<br>
					The windows systems use the event viewer<br><br>
					Virtually all log messages consist of a timestamp, a hostname and an application (program name) field, as well as some indication of the status. <br><br>
					Log entries are classified by different types the most important logs are the Warning, Alert, Emmergency, Critical etc. Less important logs are Information, debug. Types are:Error, Information, Warning, Success audit and failure audit for Windows systems, Emergency, Alert, Critical, Notice, Debug for MacOS and Linux systems<br><br>
					Types of Logging tools include<br><br>
					Syslog-ng<br>
					Nagios<br>
					Snort<br>
					Log Analysis Tools discussed are: <br><br>
					 Webalizer<br>
					ELK(elasticsearch, logstash and kibana) <br>
					SIEM(Security Information and Event Management) <br><br>
					<b>Security breaches</b><br><br>
					This focuses on security incident response plan. This must follow the PDCA mandate – plan, do, check and act. The security incident management plan should also nested with the business continuity plans and disaster recovery<br><br>
					The breach response checklist is required to ensure that breach is properly managed to conform with the ICO recommendation. This checklist should follow these steps: Check what types of data were affected?, Determine what happened?, Determine who was responsible?, Stop any escalation(s), Instigate Business Continuity Plan, Determine whether the ICO needs to be notified, Determine whether affected individuals need to be notified<br><br>
					Digital forensic involves recovering digital evidence from its storage or media and this is done in 4 phases – collection, examination, analysis and reporting. Digital forensics tools can be used for many things which include data acquisition and archiving. Examples of digital forensic tools include FTK (Forensic Toolkit), Caine, Sysinternals, SIEM, Nagios, IDS<br><br>
					
					The discussion forum initiated in the last module also continued in this module with responses made to my other colleagues. Details can be found in the peer response section of the collaborative discussion forum for Unit 8<br><br></p>
				<h3 id="unit10">Unit 10: Analysing and Mitigating Security Breaches</h3>
				<p>This Unit focused on Analysing and Mitigating Security Breaches. A seminar preparation Exercise was presented (Seminar 5) with a task on Data Breach Case Study. Several case studies were presented and we were tasked to:<br><br>
					Read Swinhoe, D., 2020. The 15 Biggest Data Breaches Of The 21St Century. [online] CSO Online. <br><br>
					
					Select one of the cases by completing Data Breach choice. Once you have made your selection, you will be able to see the links to the case. Then complete a breach checklist as discussed in the lecturecast (reproduced below):<br><br>
					
					What types of data were affected?<br>
					What happened?<br>
					Who was responsible?<br>
					Were any escalation(s) stopped - how?<br>
					Was the Business Continuity Plan instigated?<br>
					Was the ICO notified?<br>
					Were affected individuals notified?<br>
					What were the social, legal and ethical implications of the decisions made?<br>
					If you had been the ISM for the organisation you selected what mitigations would you have put in place to stop any reoccurrences?<br><br>
					
					We chose the case of  Adult Friend Finder Data breach. Details of this Exercise is captured in the Artifact section for SEMINAR 5<br><br>
					</p>
				<h3 id="unit11">Unit 11: Future Trends, Technologies and Challenges for the Information Security Industry</h3>
				<p>There was a lecture case presentation, submission of the Development Team Project executive summary and peer review submission<br><br>
					The lecture cast presented emerging trends and technologies and their challenges. The challenges faced by the IPv4 and IPv6 where extensively discussed. The challenges were categorised based on certain factors such as Adress Exhaustion, Security, Servers and Services, Co-existence and cost.<br><br>
					Secure protocols like IPsec, DNSSEC,  SSH, HTTPS, Virtual Netwroks, were designed to address some of the security challenges. IPsec uses a two part solution comprising of the Authentication Header and the Encapsulating security Payload. The DNSSEC achieves security to the Domain Name Sytem DNS which is the protocol that resolves between the Ip adress and domain URL for proper interpretation of human friendly names. DNSSEC is a security solution that ensures the integrity of DNS responses and records that are maintained. Secure Shell SSH uses cryptographic keys to encrypt a network connection securing the communication either by public-private key pairs or via simple passwords. Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) It uses either SSL/ TLS (secure socket layer/ transport layer security) to encrypt the packets from after the application protocol layer I.e, the transport and internet layers are encrypted. Network Virtualisation maximises the use of physical network infrastructure providing energy and hardware efficiency and flexibility. This can be in form of network function virtualisation (NFVs) to complete software defined network stacks (SDNs)<br><br>
					The Future Internet Architectures were summarised as  Content Centric Networks (CCN), Named Data Networking (NDN), Overlay Networks, Edge Computing, 5G(MobilityFirst)<br><br>
					Information Security Management System (ISMS) suffers setback because of factors such as Lack of Holistic management policies, inconsistency in policies, lack of granularity of policies, lack of defined and segregated functions from policies<br><br>
					
					Development Team Project: Executive Summary Assignment can be found in the Archive section<br><br>.</p>
				<h3 id="unit12">Unit 12: Debate on the Future of the Internet</h3>
				<p>This Unit is based on the debate Team Exercise which aims to present the emerging technologies and their future prospects. This is presented as a Seminar.<br><br>
					Seminar Exercise: <br><br>
					Debate<br><br>
