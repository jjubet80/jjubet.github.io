                  <p><h3>unit 1 Webstite Allocation</h3>

					<strong>Team project website allocation</strong><br><br>
					Once you have been allocated into a group, you can see which website has been allocated to your group for the activities in this module. <br><br>
					You and your group members should only use the website allocated to your group for the activities in this module. <br><br>
					There are a few 'house rules' for the use of the 'Test Sites' provided as part of the NISM assessment. Please read these carefully and adhere to them: <br><br>
					These websites use the shared hosting model. Therefore, pings and IP-based testing will not provide any useful information. Please avoid pinging these sites.<br><br>
					Do not carry out Denial of Service/ Distributed Denial of Service attacks as due to the nature of the hosting, these attacks may disrupt other users. Remember that the point of the assessment is to test and detect vulnerabilities in a specific site - ALL websites (to a greater/ lesser degree) are vulnerable to DDoS attacks.<br><br>
					You do not have admin or login access to these sites. Therefore, any social engineering attacks will need to be theoretical. They should still be considered as part of your assessment.<br><br>
					The sites are built using the freely available Softaculous scripts. You should research these as part of your initial investigations.<br><br>
					Please ensure that you do not post or store ANY personal data on these test sites as they are not secure and not part of the KAPLAN or ESSEX estate. <br><br>

							•	Which step causes the biggest delay in the route? What is the average duration of that delay?<br>
							•	What are the main nameservers for the website?<br>
							•	Who is the registered contact?<br>
							•	What is the MX record for the website?<br>
							•	Where is the website hosted?<br><br>
							Team activity<br><br>
							Discuss the results of your scans and answer the following questions with your teammates before Seminar 2.<br><br>
							•	Did you have any issues or challenges with the scans?<br>
							•	How did you overcome them?<br>
							•	How will they affect your final report?<br>

										<strong>UNIT 4-Seminar 2: TCP/IP v ISO/OSI</strong><br><br>
							Read: Russell, A.L. (2006) ‘Rough Consensus and Running Code’ and the Internet-OSI Standards War. IEEE Annals of the History of Computing.<br>Available from: https://www2.cs.duke.edu/courses/common/<br>compsci092/papers/govern/consensus.pdf<br><br>
							Then consider the following:<br><br>
							“Would the Internet we have today be much better if it was based on the ISO/ OSI 7-layer model rather than TCP/IP? “<br><br>
							Also, consider the availability, influence and impact of server and desktop tools and environments and where they came from (Commercial sources vs. Open source).<br><br>
							<strong>Analysing the post</strong><br>
							The struggle between the centralized authority and grassroots initiatives when it comes to evolving technologies or standards is perhaps a constant occurrence. The TCP/IP model can be considered a grass root initiative whereas the OSI model is from a centralized Authority. In my opinion, this phenomenon is normal and for the fact that the internet is no longer a normal business model but entails other aspects of information and communication involving Government and health sector, the OSI model should be the reference point for standardization. The OSI model provides a much more comprehensive description of networking and considering the recent advancement in Internet of things which now consist of a myriad of heterogeneous devices connected over internet, the OSI model provides a more comprehensive description of internet communication that will provide clarity in cases of complex networks.

									<strong>Question</strong><br><br>

									Communications Surveys & Tutorials 19(1):325-346. <br><br>

									Your tutor will split you into 4 teams and then you will debate the following questions: <br><br>
									
									Team 1: It is our belief that the future of the Internet is based on content centric networking (CCN &/or NDN or COAST). <br><br>
									
									Team 2: It is our belief that the future of the Internet is based on peer-to-peer overlay-based networking (BitTorrent,
									TOR, Freenet, KAD). <br><br>
									
									Team 3: It is our belief that the future of the Internet is based on the MobilityFirst architecture. <br><br>
									
									Team 4: It is our belief that the future of the Internet is based on the adoption of IPv6 and the rollout of the
									associated security measures (DNSSEC, HTTP/3, IPsec, etc.) <br><br>
									<strong>Group 2: Opening Argument</strong><br><br>
									
									
									It is our belief that the future of the Internet is based on peer-to-peer overlay-based networking: <br><br>
									
									Communication between connected devices in the internet has evolved because of the rapid growth of the internet such
									that the current physical architecture which uses the IP addressing system is unable to cater for various needs of these
									devices. Distributed systems face a challenge with this structure since every packet sent over the internet will require
									a source and destination address thus, limiting the versatility of this type of system (Ding et al, 2016). <br><br>
									
									Peer-to-peer network overlays have a major advantage of decentralizing communication, and fit technologies that are
									based on distributed systems (iQra, 2016). Overlay networks are networks that are configured on top of an existing
									physical network architecture and peer -to- peer networks provide for communication between peers over these overlays,
									without a centralized controlling body (iQra, 2016). <br><br>
									
									
									There are many advantages of the peer-to-peer overlay networks that project it as a suitable solution for future network
									advancements. Decentralisation in peer - peer networks offer great advantage because it has no single point of failure,
									and that is why emerging internet technologies like block chain, IoT and BitTorrent, take advantage of this feature
									(Kranz, 2020). <br><br>

									<strong>Group 2: Opening Argument 2</strong> <br><br>
									
	
									
									
									
									
									Peer-to-peer has become a significant social and technical phenomenon over the past year. Today's computing and
									communications environments are more complex and chaotic than classical distributed systems, without any centralised
									hierarchy or organisation. <br><br>
									
									Peer-to-peer networks are an excellent foundation for large-scale data sharing and multicast applications at the
									application level. <br><br>
									
									These networks have the potential to be an efficient routing system, self-organising, immensely scalable, and incredibly
									resilient. In addition, they integrate fault tolerance, load balancing, and a clear sense of location. <br><br>
									
									Various features are available on these Peer-to-peer networks, including selecting nearby peers, redundant storage,
									efficient searches and finding of data items, data permanence and authentication, hierarchical naming, and anonymity
									(e.g., FreeNet). <br><br>
									
									First of all, let us take an example from BitTorrent; Users can use BitTorrent to transfer data and electronic files
									over the Internet using the peer-to-peer file-sharing protocol. This enables users to distribute data and electronic
									files over the Internet decentralised. This app is available for a variety of computing platforms and operating systems. <br><br>
									
									"Torrenting", As it is called, should be approached with caution because BitTorrent Peer-to-peer networking may offer a
									convenient way to share files. Unfortunately, it has also resulted in a great deal of software piracy and illegal
									downloads where modified clients may not follow the standard protocol, and data stored on remote computers may be
									disclosed. <br><br>
									
									However, each new user must obtain an identity certificate digitally signed by a central authority to prove their
									identity. For example, a user signs a message with his private key and attaches a certificate signed by the CA. Strong
									identities prevent Sybil Attacks; if an attacker is caught, it cannot easily rejoin the system. <br><br>

									<strong>Group 2: Opening Argument 4</strong><br><br>
									
									
									It is our belief that the future of the Internet is based on peer-to-peer overlay-based networking (BitTorrent, TOR,
									Freenet, KAD). A peer to peer (P2P) overlay network is a network built on top of the internet which allows sharing of
									information without the use of IP addresses and provides a good option for large scale data sharing and content
									distribution (Eng Keong Lua et al, 2005). <br><br>
									
									
									Internet of Things (IOT) devices generate a vast amount of data over the internet and therefore require architecture
									that can support the retrieval and efficient storage of this data, peer to peer network overlay is an attractive choice
									for this due to the decentralised nature (Djellabi et al, 2020). With the increase of Internet of Things (IOT) devices
									it is becoming increasingly important for the architecture the internet is based to be able to accommodate this level of
									demand and state of the art IOT services (Oktian, 2021) therefore moving towards an architecture that can support this
									area of growth is sensible. <br><br>
									
									
									Peer to peer network overlay based networks can be easily scaled, as the information is distributed among many objects,
									but this also ensures there is no single point of failure (Kamel et al, 2019) which supports the availability of the
									network which is another factor to be considered given the large number of IOT devices reliant on network that can meet
									their demands. <br><br>

									Team 2: It is our belief that the future of the Internet is based on peer-to-peer overlay-based networking (BitTorrent,
									TOR, Freenet, KAD). <br><br>
									
									
									The peer-to-peer system is built on the principle of decentralisation. The blockchain design allows all cryptocurrencies
									to be exchanged instantaneously without middlemen, intermediaries, or an intermediary server. Anyone can set up a
									Bitcoin node to verify and validate blocks as a distributed peer-to-peer network. A blockchain is a peer-to-peer
									network-based distributed ledger that tracks one or more digital assets (Avron, 2021). All computers in a peer-to-peer
									network are linked. Each computer keeps a complete copy of the ledger and compares it to others to assure data accuracy,
									making it highly available. <br><br>
									
									Unlike banks, where transactions are privately stored and controlled solely by the banks, a central authority prevents
									users from being censored by user-to-user blockchain architecture. In addition, unlike conventional bank accounts,
									virtual currency wallets cannot be frozen or emptied by banks or governments. <br><br>
									
									
									
									The other peers are still present because of the P2P networking capability, even if one peer gets down. Thus, nobody can
									take down the blockchain. It's also very impossible to change the original file because most client hard drives must
									establish consensus with one another before a transaction can be completed. <br><br>
									
									Immutability is a feature of blockchain, which means that data can't be wiped or replaced after it's been written,
									traditional databases lack immutability, making them more vulnerable to tampering by a rogue administrator or
									third-party hackers (Sharma, 2020). <br><br>
									
									With cloud computing, you must rely on AWS and Google Drives. However, with blockchain, because it uses peer-to-peer
									networking, you do not need to rely on third parties, which can alter your data. Unfortunately, such networks are not
									immune to censorship by central authorities. <br><br>
									
									
									
									When paired with a majority consensus requirement, the distributed peer-to-peer network gives blockchains a relatively
									high degree of resistance to malicious activity like the Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks due to its decentralised
									architecture (Koegel, Hong Heather Yu and Eng Keong Lua, 2009). <br><br>
									
									
									
									However, the peer-to-peer nature of blockchain networks creates few concerns. Distributed ledgers must be updated on
									every node, similar to blockchain, and adding transactions needs a significant amount of processing resources. Although
									this increases security, it also affects efficiency, one of the key barriers to scaling and widespread use. <br><br>

				<strong>Initial Post</strong><br></p>
				<p>Research was conducted by a team of computing students to demonstrate the viability of breaching a production-deployed medical training mannequin. The research was carried out with an active medical training device in the College of Nursing at the University of South Alabama. Why this was important is because of the increasing integration of technology into medical field creating new avenues for malicious attacks with potentially serious cybercrime consequences.<br><br>
				The research demonstrated that a brute force attack and a denial-of-service (DoS) attack can be successfully carried out on a Medical Mannequin via the network communication between the medical mannequin and the controlling computer. The tool used was a medical mannequin called Istan mannequin, which uses the TCP network protocol and 802.11 wireless transmissions between the controlling laptops and the iStan’s internal access point<br><br>
				The Denial-of-service (DoS) attack works by sending many TCP requests by an attacker to a destination device and in this case, a script called mdk3 was used to send disconnect signals to the access point on iStan, which evidenced connection error message during the DoS attack. In mitigating this type of attack, one approach is to reduce the time-out period for request to prune the connection in the TCP queue (Schuba et al., 1997). In this case, since the communication is between a dedicated computer and the Istan, a very low time-out can be set which is only necessary for a communication between the Istan and the dedicated computer within its network. A study of the best connection time-out will be done to get the desired time without risk of dropping legitimate packets in slow connections (Qualys Security Blog, 2011). This will also come with more bandwidth and connection speed requirement between the computer and the Istan.<br><br>
				Monitoring and filtering activities can be set up with the aim of identifying unusual traffic and filtering them. One method is the History-based filtering. An understanding of a normal traffic as well the devices that connect to the Medical Mannequin is maintained. Unusual Ip addresses or traffic are then filtered and discarded (Mahjabin et al., 2017)<br><br>
				A brute force attack works by guessing login details to access the system. The report shows that the password length adopted is 8 characters and apparently, the access point ID is the same as the password. It took just 2 hrs to get these login Information. A password policy can be adopted to ensure only strong passwords can be used to access the system. For example, Minimum password length should be at least 12 characters, include both upper and lower case letters, include numeric characters and include some special characters like &,#,@,$,% (Dave, 2013).<br><br>
				Another approach is to adopt the two factor or multi factor authentication such that aside the PIN and ID of the Access point, a second level authentication is implemented using other means like one time password or behavioural recognition (Ometov et al., 2018). The attacker, who might be able the guess password will need to also provide a second level authentication hence will be discouraged from using brute force.<br><br>
				Although Medical mannequin may be a simulated medical environment, there is the risk of cybercriminals tampering with medical training information to incorrectly assess medical situations and provide inaccurate feedback hence, understanding the security implication of an unprotected medical equipment that is integrated into the internet, will not only prevent breaches, but also save lives.<br><br><br>

				Post by Agne Angelides<br><br>
				Hi Jurbe<br> thank you for your informative post<br>
				You talk about conducting the network communications history review and compiling an allowed list of IP addresses as a way to mitigate the DOS attack as well as monitoring activities. For this type of mitigation to work, there has to be an IP address database maintained by someone. In the past, all medical devices had static IP addresses, which made this task much easier, however, most of the recent devices use the Dynamic Host Configuration protocol (DHCP) (Forsythe-Stephens, 2017) nowadays, which means that the same tool could have multiple IP addresses throughout its lifetime making. This could potentially make the monitoring activity harder since you may be able to identify the 'rogue' IP address but not the device it is associated especially since not all manufacturers populate the DHCP class ID details (Forsythe-Stephens, 2017).<br>
				There is also always a concern over the DHCP server being taken over and handing out legitimate IP addresses to untrusted users (Weinberg, 2022).
				With this in mind, do you think the IP address filtering is still the best option for 'weeding' out unwanted traffic or perhaps other options, would be more suitable?<br><br>

				Reply to Agne Angelides<br><br>
				Hi Agne Angelides,<br>
				This was a thoughtful response.<br><br>. The DHCP as you rightly mentioned, will generate random IP addresses however, Networks can be further segmented and the DHCP server assigned IPs that are within a pool of whitelisted addresses with the aim of having smaller IPs for filtering. For example, for IPV4 addressing system using subnet masking, A DHCP Server can maintain pools of say 8 addresses each that can be used to assign to a defined set of end users or host computers. The DHCP Server will therefore only assign random addresses from this pool of IP addresses. An Access list can then filter connections based on this pool of IP addresses. That means, by creating smaller network segments, the DHCP challenge can be managed. Also to better manage this, the Istan and the other host computers can be segmented to be within the same network (Allen, 2020).

				I also quite agree that the IP address filtering may not be the best option for 'weeding' out unwanted traffic. In my opinion, a better approach should be with the packet data attributes instead. Packet filtering technologies now use Machine learning algorithms to identify patterns of DoS/DDoS attacks based on analysing attributes like number of packets, average packet size, time interval variance, packet size variance, number of bytes, packet rate and bit rate(Glăvan et al. 2019). This has proven to be more effective than other methods (Dickson, 2020).<br><br>

				<strong>Peer Response from Agne Angelides</strong><br><br>
				thank you for your response.<br><br>
				I agree with you, packet filtering, in my opinion, is a better way forward, since it can also be used to for filtering out particular IP addresses, but it also provides many other checks, in addition to those mentioned by yourself, such as: excluding packets with certain transport header tags or network header options, the interface on which packet was received, etc. (Turcanik, 2015).
				However, no packet filtering is bulletproof, in my opinion, and its usefulness depends on its implementation. The firewall administrator must have a good understanding of the vulnerabilities and business to be able to configure packet filtering rules optimal for the business.<br><br>

				<strong>Peer Response By Hamad Ahmad</strong><br><br>
				Hello Jurbe, I am impressed by how you explain the risks of simulating medical mannequins in the medical environment and the potential countermeasures for the potential attacks. This indicates you conducted in-depth research on the potential threats and vulnerabilities likely to attack the medical devices. I can see that you have comprehensively discussed the viability of breaching production-deployed medical training mannequin. Indeed, integrating more technology into the medical field creates new avenues for malicious attacks with potential cybercrimes. I agree that network communication between medical mannequin and the controller computer can potentially cause brute force attacks and Denial-of-Service attacks. This happens because the Istan mannequin uses the network protocol and 820.11 wireless transmissions between the controlling laptops and the iStan’s internal access point (Schuba et al., 1997). How does Istan mannequin using network protocols and 820.11 wireless transmissions increases the vulnerability to attacks?<br><br>
				Your position on how Denial of service attack occurs is quite compelling. I support your opinion that DoS works by sending several TCP requests by attackers to destination attacks, and the mdk3 script sends disconnect signals to the iStan access point and subsequently, connection error message appears (Mahjabin et al., 2017). What happens after the connection error message appear? It is true; brute force attack can guess the log-in details to access the system (Dave, 2013). Therefore, systems with simple and short passwords are more vulnerable to this attack. Having read through your post, I am convinced by your proposed mitigation measures of reducing the time-out period for requests to prune the connection in TCP queue for the DoS and adopting a multi-factor authentication and stronger passwords for the brute force attack are effective.<br><br>
				Generally, I feel that your post is educative and has tackled the challenges of simulating medical mannequins in the healthcare system. You also reflected a deep understanding of the topic, giving it all your best. I, therefore, wish to say that you deserve the best.<br><br>

				<strong>Peer Response by Abidemi Adelakun</strong><br><br>
				Thanks for the interesting read about the huge TCP requests sent by an attacker to a destination device and how it can be mitigated by reducing the time-out from the default to a shorter time, this could help in pruning the half-open connections from the TCP queue. This works by keeping bogus connections from staying too long in the backlog which will free up space for the legitimate connections (Villing, 2019) but as you said also there is an additional risk of dropping legitimate packets in slow connections since lowering the timeout may deny legitimate access for machines which round trips exceed the timeout period Schuba et al (N.D). A study of the best connection timeout could be done to get the desired time before any connections are dropped during the normal traffic conditions (Attack Detection and Prevention User Guide, N.D). My question goes thus what happens if the legitimate connection time and the dos attack connections attempts are of almost the same timing?<br><br>
				As you said earlier, brute force attacks work by guessing login details to access the system, and the password length adopted is 8 characters. To attack the mannequin using the brute force attack the students chose the open-source software Reaver. Gilson et al. state that Reaver allows a brute force attack against Wi-FI Protected Setup register PIN numbers (Reaver WPS ; Viehböck 2011). Reaver works by executing a brute-force attack against the WPS PIN (Swanagan, N.D). Every WPS pin consists of an 8 digit long number. which means there is a total of 10 raised to power 8 permutations which creates a relatively short time to establish the brute force attack. once the WPS PIN is found, the WPA PSK key can be recovered, even with reasonable complexity (Tay, 2020).  To mitigate this the WPS has to be either disabled or if updated firmware is available for the device, then it can be patched (Swan, N.D).<br><br>

				Compromising a Medical Mannequin.<br>
				It has been observed that the pace of technological advancement in the medical industry is faster than the pace of cyber security considerations (Glisson et al., 2015). The critical observation is that a breach of a training tool would result in a clinician receiving incorrect guidance when problem-solving is insightful. A discrepancy between technology and security considerations in this industry can potentially result in a fatality.<br>
				The studies were conducted on a mannequin model (istan), a wireless patient simulator used at the university's College of Nursing. The device can bleed, secrete bodily fluids, has blood pressure and heart rate, and breathes realistically. The simulator links with iStan software, which controls the mannequin remotely (Still, 2015). By identifying the network security solution and network protocol as the vulnerable components, brute-force attacks against the router PIN, as well as denial-of-service attacks using open-source tools such as Backtrack
				The tools implemented in this experiment were not sophisticated or difficult to acquire. However, this alone highlights the lack of security currently being implemented in these devices.<br><br>
				A brute force attack that targeted the Wi-Fi and a denial-of-service attack rendering the unit inoperable were used to demonstrate the vulnerability of the medical
				mannequin. A Denial of service (DOS) attack is designed to shut down or make the target unusable. This is accomplished by flooding the target with a large amount of data that the device cannot handle, causing it to become unresponsive.<br><br>

 				There are several ways to mitigate brute force attacks, such as changing passwords frequently, increasing password length, limiting login attempts, and
				implementing multifactor authentication. A proactive approach would be setting up alerts for brute force attacks and monitoring and stopping them before they
				are fully deployed (Varonis, 2021).<br><br>

				DOS attacks can be prevented by proactively monitoring a system for any unusual activity by creating a baseline. In addition to this monitoring, an effective method could also be to implement a VPN with MFA required to access the medical device (Phoenixnapp,2018). Over the years, medical devices have gone from being utterly non-connected to being both wirelessly and software controlled. It's worth bearing in mind that there is an international standard to which medical devices must certify; The IEC 62304 Medical device software, which was put in place to prevent cyber-criminal events on medical devices. However, the standard has not been updated to consider and include either network connectivity or cybersecurity (Williams, Woolward, 2015). When medical device manufacturers are required by law to implement strict security measures into the lifecycle of their products, we will likely see the threats above, and vulnerabilities decrease.<br><br>

				Hi Samuel,<br><br>
				What a great insight on international standards to which medical devices must certify. As you rightly mentioned, It is quite unfortunate that the standards have not been updated to consider and include either network connectivity or cyber security. Also to note, some of the sanctions and penalties for non-compliance needs to be updated.<br><br>
				Looking at some of the standards and penalties with regards to medical equipment and Cybercrime, You will also agree that they are not in phase with the recent spate of cybercrime. In the USA for instance, The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) provides guidance to help medical devices manufacturers design and maintain products that are cyber secure. It also protects patient’s interest by urging manufacturers to monitor and assess cyber security vulnerability risks, and to be proactive about disclosing vulnerabilities and solutions to address them (The U.S Food & Drug Administration, 2020).<br><br>
				In other countries like Australia, where there are identified Cyber security vulnerabilities, threats and risks that pose an immediate and significant threat to the health and safety of users, or if there is an indication that there is actual or potential product tampering, such devices may require an immediate recall (Australian Government, 2021).<br><br>
				In England and Wales, The computer misuse Act of 1990 noted that it is an offence to cause a computer to perform any function with the intent to secure unauthorized access to any program or data. For Example, Hacking or unauthorized access attracts a maximum penalty of 2 years. If the crime further aggravates to theft, the penalty is 5 years Imprisonment (ICLG.com, N.D)<br><br>
				These examples and many others show that there are existing guiding regulatory checks to Cyber security incidences for medical equipment however, the changing landscape of Cybercrime and the increased connectedness of medical devices has given rise to more vulnerabilities. According to the 2022 State of Healthcare IoT Device Security Report from Cynerio, 53% of internet-connected medical devices analyzed were found to have a known vulnerability, while one-third of bedside devices were identified to have a critical risk (Murray, A. (2022).<br><br>
				Recent attacks can be seen in 2021. Cancer patients undergoing radiation treatment in East Greenwich had their appointments moved due to a software outage caused by a cyber-attack on an outside vendor (Shaun Towne, Kait Walsh, Chelsea Jones 2021). In December 2021 there was a ransomware attack in the Maryland state's Department of Health which affected the COVID-19 response in the state for that month. Access to critical databases for communicable diseases, lab reports and more were affected Greig, J. (2022).<br><br>
				It is therefore clear, that the existing standards and regulatory checks are not creating the needed impact to curtail cybercrime on medical equipment. A much more ardent and stricter standard as well as regulatory sanctions need to be put in place to strengthen the current security solutions provided for Medical equipment<br><br>

							Major Threats and Vulnerabilities Discussed in the Paper<br><br>
							 
							          The healthcare sector faces a high risk of cyber-attacks as most organizations are inadequately prepared for information security challenges in the modern technologically advanced society. Glisson et al. (2015) indicate that critical information assets in the medical industry are poorly protected and often compromised. Although data from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) suggests that hospitals have not reported injuries or deaths linked to cyber-attacks on medical devices, the risk continues to rise as the healthcare sector adopts more technological innovations.<br><br>
							 
							          Hospitals report increasing vulnerabilities and internal weaknesses that hackers can exploit to access critical infrastructure (Glisson et al. 2015; Jalali & Kaiser 2020). For instance, implantable devices used to identify patients, monitor vital signs, and control medication can be compromised through cyber-attacks. Information security breaches can impede hospital operations and result in financial losses (Argaw et al. 2020; Brilingaitė et al. 2022). While identification in healthcare processes is essential in delivering care to the right patients, it is vulnerable to risks such as malicious tracking and information gathering and dissemination. Health institutions need to protect critical infrastructure from cyber-attacks to deliver effective care.<br><br>
							 
							          Monitoring and control healthcare devices are also at a high risk of cyber-attacks. Glisson et al. (2015) state that monitoring tools are important in assessing patients’ physiological conditions, while control devices are used to dispense medication or regulate vital organs such as the heart and brain. Apart from attacks similar to those associated with patient identification, monitoring tools are vulnerable to denial of service. Cyber attackers are capitalizing on increased remote working to gain access to individuals’ confidential data (He et al. 2021). For instance, they can attack glucose monitors and transmit incorrect data to the insulin pumps to jeopardize patients’ health. Since various healthcare tools are at a high risk of cyber-attacks, medical training facilities are not spared. Glisson et al. (2015) show that medical professionals in training institutions can use compromised data to assess situations and conduct educational programs if modifications to healthcare tools are not detected at the right time. The article demonstrates that cyber-attacks can affect the quality of medical training if hackers alter vital patient monitoring and treatment control tools.<br><br>
							 
							Mitigating the Threats<br><br>
							 
							          I would mitigate the threats to medical tools by promoting collaboration between healthcare providers and cyber security professionals to ensure that hospitals develop effective programs for preventing hackers from compromising vital devices. Healthcare organizations can also implement proper encryption systems while enhancing medical systems’ functionality. For instance, healthcare personnel utilizing glucose monitors in their routine work should use passwords to access patient information to prevent unauthorized individuals from compromising vital data. Therefore, hospitals need to promote cyber security training to raise employees’ awareness of the need to safeguard critical assets.<br><br>

							<strong>Peer Response by Jurbe Jubet</strong><br><br>
							That was a good strategy. It is important for medical equipment manufacturers to understand Cyber security and the risk their equipment may pose to its users. <br><br>
							Cybercrime has exploded over the past decade and no organization is left out. The severity is perhaps more with the health sector considering that such cybercrime incidences apparently do not only focus on financial gain, but also impacts on the Human life. The Istan is only but one of such medical equipment that is vulnerable to Cyber-attacks. The need for collaboration between Medical equipment manufacturers and cyber professionals is very important.<br><br>
							To further highlight the importance of this strategy, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in a publication done last year, noted that Digital Imaging and Communications standard used by picture archiving communication systems(PACS)  is open to thousands of vulnerable PACS servers exploits, when connected to the Internet. Medical equipment like ultrasound, CT, MRI and other radiology files which contain patient medical records are stored and exchanged on PACS servers. Fortunately however, a team of cyber researchers were able to identify these vulnerabilities and notices where sent out to users of these machine to update the necessary patches (Miliard, 2021). Had there been a collaboration before these systems were developed, these vulnerabilities would have been minimal or perhaps eliminated.<br><br>
							The sophistication in design should not only be driven by its medical relevance, but also how secured it is from attack. The Medical equipment manufacturer may not understand the danger posed by its equipment being connected to the internet hence, there is the need to collaborate with Cyber security professionals to identify vulnerabilities and ways to prevent them.<br><br>

					Initial Post By Tebogo Victor Sodaba<br><br><br>

					The paper has identified that there are no policies and procedures in place to identify weaknesses as well as remediation of such before they are exploited by threats. The identification methods could include among others penetration assessments on the assets. Another area of concern was that there was no security culture within the health fraternity as such fail-open practices were preferred over fail-safe ones due to the nature of the environment. However, these could lead to cyber disruptions and compromise of the health services<br><br>.
					 
					As a result, the equipment was found to be susceptible to brute force where password guessing methods could be repeatedly applied until access is granted. Another area of concern was that the denial-of-service threats could also be performed on the medical which could have catastrophic consequences.<br><br>
					 
					Several safeguards could be employed to protect the assets from these threats. First, the firewall or intrusion prevention systems should be implemented to guard against denial-of-service attacks. While brute force attack could be mitigated by strong password practices, employing multi factor authentication methods, and implementing procedures for the review of security log activities in order to identify breaches. Awareness training initiatives are also important to inculcate the security culture in the hospital environment.<br><br><br>
					<strong>Peer Response by Jurbe Jubet</strong><br><br>
					It is an important point you made regarding Awareness training initiatives to inculcate the security culture in the hospital environment.<br><br>
					The security solutions to brute force attack and DoS cannot be complete with only Technical solutions. Human factors directly or indirectly play a role in security breaches. Countering cyber threats requires a focus on people and behavior's, not just technology (Federal Information System Security Educators Association, N.D). Many recorded cyber-attacks have been successfully carried out in the presence of technical security solutions by exploiting human-factor vulnerabilities related to security knowledge and skills (Ani et al, 2019).<br><br>
					Security Awareness campaigns should be part of the Hospital management functions. This can come in form of an information security management system or Information security management policy. The goal will be to drive consciousness among the users of medical equipment’s, IoT devices and the general Exposure to security incidences.<br><br>
					Aside this, the rapid evolving advancements in information communication technology as well as its interconnectivity with various other devices(IoT), like in this case, the medical equipment’s, will also widen the knowledge gap of its users over time. There is need for medical institutions to also match the rapid growth in these advancements by frequently updating its information security awareness initiative so that users are at all-time, aware of the security implications of the medical equipment or IoT devices they are using.<br><br>

				<h5 id="summary1">Summary Post</h5>
				<p>The Medical institution has found usefulness in the internet and now represents one of the fastest growing sectors in the IoT market(Order, N.D.). Several medical equipments are now connected to the internet including health monitoring devices, robotic surgery equipment and Medical training Devices. These medical equipments may also be vulnerable to cyber-attacks and breaches because of the sensitivity of healthcare information<br><br>
					A medical training equipment in form of a Medical Mannequin was used to demonstrate the vulnerability of medical equipments to Cyber attacks. Students in a University of South Alabama successfully carried out brute force attack and denial of services on the Medical Mannequin (Glisson et. al., 2015)<br><br>
					The discussion forum was set to identify major threats and vulnerabilities on the Medical Mannequin and how to mitigate against these attacks<br><br>
					The Initial post highlight the major threats carried out which were the Brute force attack, and denial of service attack. The system was found vulnerable to these attacks.<br><br>
					In mitigating the Dos attack, an approach was discussed to reduce the time-out period for TCP request to prune the connection in the TCP queue (Schuba et al., 1997). Other requirements suggested for this where increased bandwidth and connection speed, Monitoring and filtering activities for unusual traffic using History-based filtering.<br><br>
					In mitigating the Brute force attack, solutions suggested were, strong passwords and adopting the two factor or multi factor authentication as a second level authentication (Ometov et al., 2018)<br><br>
					Agne Angelides rightly observed that for the DoS attack, IP address filtering will not be an easy task since the recent devices use the Dynamic Host Configuration protocol (DHCP). She pointed out that packet filtering, is a better way forward, since it also provides many other checks. She also Opined that no packet filtering is still bulletproof, and its usefulness depends on its implementation with sound knowledge on the part of the administrator (Angelides, 2022).<br><br>
					Hamad Ahmad raised a questions such as How does Istan mannequin using network protocols and 820.11 wireless transmissions increases the vulnerability to attacks?,  What happens after the connection error message appear?(Ahmad, 2022). This network solution is indeed vulnerable as demonstrated by the successful brute- force attack and DoS attack. Other known vulnerabilities are Session Hijacking, Man-in-the-Middle attack, Passive/Active Eavesdropping Attacks(Welsh, et al. N.D) . It was also evident in the research that the program was not able to send any setting changes to the iStan medical mannequin because of the attack.<br><br>
					Abidemi Adelakun Raised a question with regards to Mitigating DoS attacks. what happens if the legitimate connection time and the dos attack connections attempts are of almost the same timing? (Adelakun, 2022) However, as mentioned in the initial post, Monitoring and filtering can be set up with the aim of identifying unusual traffic. A history-based monitoring and filtering will give an understanding of what is unusual. Also, the idea of reducing the Syn-Received timeout is to free up the queue. Bandwidth allocation can be increased and Maximum connection rule implemented such that the Impact of the DoS is reduced (Center for Internet Security, 2017).<br><br>
					Abidemi Adelakun also noted that the Every WPS pin consists of an 8-digit long number which can easily be hacked once the WPS PIN is found, the WPA PSK key can be recovered, hence, to mitigate this, the WPS has to be either disabled or if updated firmware is available for the device, then it can be patched(Adelakun, 2022).<br><br>
					Information technology improves healthcare, however, the challenges that come with these technologies like IoT needs to be better managed else the consequences associated with Cybercrime may incidentally out way its benefits. The medical mannequin was successfully attacked such that the program was unable to send any settings changes to the equipment. This is a sign that such a scenario could happen to patient monitoring device and could lead to much more severe consequences on a patient. It therefore becomes imperative, that medical IoT devices should be secure to avoid endangering human life.<br><br>

			<p>Websites are hosted online with certain technical and administrative information and services that may not be displayed during normal browsing. These information like IP addresses, Mail exchange servers, name server records, routing hops etc may not be visible during normal web access.  There are however several specialised tools available that reveal this information.<br><br>
				A blog site https://allmytype.co.uk/index.php?/archives/1-inspiration.html presented for this Exercise was scanned by the group 2 team using available network scan tools like the Network-tools.com, windows command line and Terminal traceroute tool. The Network-tools.com was used to identify administrative information while the trace route was used to identify routes from the user computer to the website. The tools revealed that the IP address of the website is 68.66.247.187. The Number of hops from the user’s computer to the assigned website was 14 hops for one computer and 10 for the other. The step with the longest delay was hop 2 taking an average of 413ms to the next router. The Nameservers for the website are ns1.a2hosting.com, ns2.a2hosting.com, ns3.a2hosting.com and ns4.a2hosting.com. the MX record is 0.mail.allmytype.co.uk and the site was hosted at A2 hosting Inc (Network Tools.com, 2019) <br><br>
				While information such as nameserver, Ip address, MX record and hosting site were revealed to be the same irrespective of the scan tool used, the traceroute however had a more interesting and dynamic information. The results for the traceroute where quite different and appears to differ based on the location of the computer used for the scan. Scan done by the team, noted that One computer located in the UK, had lower round-trip times and fewer number of Hops than other located in Nigeria. Several routers could be sighted for the 2 separate internet services providers with one provider routing packets between 5 routers and the other between 8 routers within its network.  The reason for multiple routers can be concluded for added security and scalability. For some of the routes, there were no details provided. This could be because the routers dropped the packets because of a firewall or because they were not configured to reply to traceroute packets (Carrigan, 2019) <br><br>

				<strong>Peer response from Kevin Peuhkurinen</strong><br><br>
					Hi Jurbe. Thank you for the great post. I was very interested to hear that one of your group members had a latency delay of over 400ms at hop 2. Usually the first hop in a traceroute is from the local computer to the local router, and hop 2 is the connection to the Internet Service Provider (Mitchell, 2014). This would mean that the high latency is likely a result of the Internet connection type used by this individual. According to Christiansen (2021), only satelite Internet connections tend to have latency over 400ms.<br><br>
					I would be interested to know if you determined the Internet connection type used by this individual, and whether you think that different connection types might affect security scans. <br><br>

							<strong>Peer response to Kevin Peuhkurinen</strong><br><br>
							I Actually noticed there was significant difference in Latency between my tracert figures and that of my Team mates.<br><br>
					I used a home router which has provision for a SIM card for internet connection. The mobile internet service providers in my location use the 3G/4G mobile wireless internet. 5G is available in some locations.<br><br>
					Based on the operation mode of the service providers in my location Nigeria, Internet connections are routed through base stations which are designated service stations, located at strategic points either interconnected via fibre optic cables or wireless depending on there desired coverage(ncc.gov.ng., N.D).<br><br>
					In my case, I believe the high latency at hop 2 might have been as a result of a network downtime at a particular base station which perhaps lead to the packet being routed through an alternative route that was much more slower or father away from my designated base station.<br><br>
					Also, My Router SIM settings shows that I can use the 3G network or 4G network, although it is currently set at automatic, to use both network types depending on availability. therefore, since the service providers use the 3G/4G Network mode, it could be that the connection to Hop 2 was at a higher latency connection of 3G network at the time I did the tracert.  Since I had a latency of over 400ms (High Performance Browser Networking., N.D).<br><br>
					I came to this conclusion after I observed that a recent tracert I did gave a much more lower Latency of 166ms at the 2nd Hop. With the various connection types having impact on latency in varying degrees, the results of security scans will also vary based on these connection types<br><br>

						<strong>Peer Response from Beran</strong><br><br>
						Informative post.<br><br>
						The fact that many of the troubleshooting options are free and freely accessible, as well as being possible without registration, enables a good threat analysis for website operators on the one hand. On the other hand, this also poses a risk, since hackers can also spy on websites for their vulnerabilities without in-depth knowledge. Website operators must therefore be aware of this threat.<br><br>
						Any thoughts? <br><br>
						
						<strong>Response to Beran</strong><br><br>

						Hi Beran,<br><br>
						You made a valid point on the benefits these troubleshooting options might also present to hackers, since they can also spy on websites for vulnerabilities.<br><br>
						To say more on this, I will refer to Ross Anderson in his book on Security Engineering. As mentioned in the book, the Government fought and restricted knowledge of cryptography until the turn of the century. There was also an intention to ban books on locksmithing, all with the concern that criminals may have access to these information and cause more harm. Anderson however argued that while some bad guys will benefit from knowing these tricks, which they mostly already know, the good guys will benefit more because they probably did not know it at all(Anderson, 2020)<br><br>
						
						In this light, I would say it is important that security professionals, website developers and operators have it at the back of their mind when using these tools, that the person at the other end probably knows how to use it better. Experienced Hackers can also form part of the team to share more knowledge from a Hackers perspective<br><br>

						<P>
								<strong>INITIAL POST BY GROUP 1</strong><br><br>
								During the Unit 3 we have been asked to perform quick individual scans on the website assigned to our team (Group 1): https://loadedwithstuff.co.uk/<br><br>
								Our team used a combination of traceroute, tracert, and tracepath to record the number of hops to our destination. The number varied between 10 and 15. The hop with the highest latency, presented itself between the middle and the end of the traceroute, i.e. between hops 7 and 11 respectively. No lost packets were observed.<br><br>
								The differences in the hop numbers can be explained by our geographical locations (Fei et al, 1998) and our internet providers; our team members have conducted these scans from the UK, Canada, Qatar and Nigeria. The latency differences will be due to the differences between our bandwidth.<br><br>
								Next we were asked to find the mail and name servers for the domain. We used a combination of nslookup and web-based tools to identify the name servers below. This indicated to us that the site is being hosted by A2 Hosting.<br><br>
								•	ns1.a2hosting.com<br>
								•	ns2.a2hosting.com<br>
								•	ns3.a2hosting.com<br>
								•	ns4.a2hosting.com<br>
								The MX record for the assigned site was confirmed by everyone to be mail.loadedwithstuff.co.uk. <br><br>
								Next we were asked to provide the registered contact for the domain. Again we used a combination of the whois command and various web-based resources. We were able to confirm that the registrar for the site is: <br><br>
								•	eNom LLC [Tag = ENOM] <br>
								•	URL: http://www.enom.com<br>
								While contact information for domains used to be public information, this was changed as a result of the introduction of the GDPR when the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) agreed to start treating this data as personal information that needs to be kept private (Goyal, 2018).<br><br> 
								The final part of the scan was to identify the physical location of the server hosting the site. Using a variety of web-based IP address geolocation services, we initially suspected that the server was hosted in the USA. However, IP address geolocation is not always accurate, especially when considering addresses assigned to Internet companies, which are free to assign their addresses without regard to geography (IPLocation, 2016). With this in mind, we looked more closely at the network hops identified in our trace routes. These routes all seemed to point to Amsterdam as the correct location. One of our group resides in North America, which made their route particularly interesting; if the site was in the USA then their route should be quite short. Instead, the route showed a trans-Atlantic hop from Montreal to Liverpool which would not have been necessary if the site was in the USA (Pepelnjak, 2019). Based on all of the evidence available, we concluded that the hosting server is most likely located in Amsterdam.
								Difficulties experienced by the team members were also discussed during the team meeting, and it appears that most were due to the lack of hands-on network experience.<br><br>

								Internet providers often use IATA airport codes to identify the geographic location of routers on their network (Lamberti, 2020). In the tracepath, you can see that my local Internet Service Provider hands off my packets at hop 6 to Cogent Communications. Cogent clearly uses IATA codes, so you can read the path from hop 6 in Toronto (YYZ) to hop 7 in Montreal (YMQ) to hop 8 in Liverpool (LPL) to hop 9 in Amsterdam (AMS). At that point, Cogent hands the packets off to A2 Hosting for the last mile to our target server. If the packets continued back from Amsterdam to the USA, we would see additional hops after that. <br><br>
								It is also important to note that my longest delay occurs between 7 and 8, which is a trans-Atlantic hop from Montreal to Liverpool. Routing on the Internet is controlled by the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). BGP uses many different factors to select a routing path, but generally speaking it tries to select the shortest, fastest, and/or most efficient route (IPXO, 2022). If the site really is in the USA, it would be illogical for my packets to go from Canada to the UK to the Netherlands, and then back across the ocean to the USA<br><br>.

								<strong>Peer response by JurbeJubet</strong><br><br>
								Thank you Kevin for this information on BGP.<br><br> 
								Your group really had an interesting post worth studying. You also made it quite simple to understand and follow.<br><br>
								As you rightly observed, the BGP uses different factors in selecting its routing path. One of such factors is the ASN (Autonomous system number). This is a number assigned to a network or a collection of networks that are all managed, controlled and supervised by a single entity or organization within the BGP routing policy. BGP uses the ASN to uniquely identify each of such systems (www.thousandeyes.com., N.D). While checking the ASN, I observed something I want to share with you.<br><br> 
								The Internet service provider Cogentco, maintains a BGP IP routing information with ASN 55293, which featured its linked route from its router, euroaccess-ltd.demarc.cogentco.com (hop 10), to the web hosting router v402.R2.NL1.a2webhosting.com(Hop 11) (publicdata.caida.org., N.D)<br><br>
								A look up on the ASN number 55293 indicates this ASN is linked with A2 Hosting Inc located in USA, pairing with cogent communications also in USA (bgp.tools., N.D).<br><br>
								This suggest that the route was moved back to USA from Amsterdam, that is from hop 10 to hop 11 still within the cogentco network, before arriving at v402.R2.NL1.a2webhosting.com(hop 12), still in the USA.<br><br>
								Another observation to suggest the packet was possibly moved back to the US, is the Latency of 106.195ms between hop 10 and hop 11, which appears to have a high Latency, and may indicate that the packet was routed through a longer distance.<br><br>

									Hi Jurbe.<br><br>
									Zorz (2019) describes how cognitive biases can undermine cybersecurity programs. Particularly relevant for this topic is anchoring and confirmation bias. Anchoring bias describes our tendency to accept the first piece of information that we come across as the absolute truth, and confirmation bias describes our tendency to only look for evidence that fits our theories. In this situation, I cannot help but feel that a number of people have performed a web-based IP address geolocation on the site and have 'anchored' onto the result that the site should be in the USA. Confirmation bias has then prevented them from critically examining this anchor, and instead caused them to look only for data that supports this theory.<br><br>
									To address your specific point, Yacobi-Keller, et. al. (2009) describe how IP addresses associated with a single autonomous system (AS) need not be in a single country or even a single continent.<br><br>

									Hi Jurbe, <br><br>

									thank you for your response<br><br> 
									When I did my basic scans and analysed my traceroute results, I was of the same opinion to start with - I could swear that the web server was hosted in the US. However, as Kevin has mentioned up above, the IP geolocation lookup tools should probably be used more carefully and the location provided should be verified against other factors (delays between hops, router titles). <br><br>
									Whilst researching on this subject to prepare for team discussion, I found quite a lot of information which explains how these location lookup services work and why they often lack accuracy. Dan et al. in their paper (2021) on the IP geolocation lookup through reverse DNS does a very good job at explaining it. For example, most of these location lookup services use a topology or a network delay method. The latter issues pings to your provided IP address from different geographical locations, measures the delay and then triangulates into an approximate location. However, routes taken to the target IP address do not always correspond to geographical routes, there are also scalability issues (many servers are required to conduct multiple pings to the same IP address for accurate results). Due to these reasons, you often get an incorrect location when using a geolocation lookup tools available.<br><br>
									There is also IP availability issue to consider. Many companies lease IP addresses from a pool of IP addresses available in another company. These leased addresses will be registered to the service provider company rather than the company leasing it, and so if the IP location lookup tool is using the registered address, then you would get the address of the service provider rather than the actual location of your device (a2hosting, 2022)<br><br>

											<p><strong>Summary Post</strong><br><br>
												A Website assessment was performed as a group exercise with tools like Nslookup, Whois and traceroute to extract administrative information on the blog site https://allmytype.co.uk<br><br>
												The information retrieved such as name servers, IP address of the site, traceroute, Mx record, Registrar, and location of the website were analyzed and discussed with the Team<br><br>
												The results indicates that the administrative information were basically the same for each of the test and tools used except for traceroute which was quite different for each team member. This difference was due to several factors but the most visible is that of geography since the group members performing the test where located in different countries and traceroute usually initiates a trace from the source of the trace(Wilson, 2019).<br><br>
												Responding to my results, Kevin analyse the traceroute information and observed that one of the group members had a latency delay of over 400ms at hop 2. Kevin was of the opinion that the technology used could have resulted in this  significant lag (Peuhkurinen, 2022). further review noted that his point was valid and another possibility observed was that of network downtime which could result in packets being routed through longer paths.<br><br>
												Beran also commented on the tools used raising a concern that since the troubleshooting tools are freely accessible, hackers can use it to also spy on websites for their vulnerabilities (Necat, 2022). This is unfortunately the truth, however, security processionals who understand this concern will also look at every perspective, utilizing experience to their own advantage.<br><br>
												Overall, the exercise was an interesting, collaborative hands-on activity. I had the opportunity to assess a website's administrative information and interpret this information with the help of my colleagues. There were other interesting results from my team mates which gave an insight on the dynamic nature of scan results and how these differing results could also point out to underlying network issues or vulnerabilities.<br><br>

										COLLABORATIVE DISCUSSION 3 <br>
										<strong>Discussion Topic:</strong><br>
										Read the website at Data Protection Commission (2020) CaseStudies|DataProtection Commission Available from:
										https://dataprotection.ie/en/pre-gdpr/case-studies <br>
										There are several case studies published during years 2014 – 2018 concerning GDPR related issues and breaches.
										Considering the case study you have chosen answer the following questions: <br>
										<ul>
											<li>What is the specific aspect of GDPR that your case study addresses?</li>
											<li>How was it resolved?</li>
											<li>If this was your organisation what steps would you take as an Information Security Manager to mitigate the issue?</li>
										</ul>
										Post your responses to the discussion. Your initial posting should respond to the question and be at least 200 words
										long. The initial post should be labelled
										‘Initial Post’.<br>
										You should demonstrate that you understand the topic covered and ensure you use references to academic literature
										(journals, books, reports, etc.). This activity will provide evidence of your personal growth and your summary post is
										required in your e-portfolio. <br><br>
										<strong>‘Initial Post’.</strong><br><br>
										The Case study is on Loss of sensitive personal data contained in an evidence file kept by An Garda Síochána <br><br>
										
										A complain was filed by a couple towards An Garda Síochána(AGS), concerning the loss of an evidence file that held the
										couple’s sensitive personal data relating to details of a medical treatment. <br><br>
										
										Medical record, is a sensitive information and according to GDPR Article 9, data concerning health falls under the
										special category of personal data(Official Journal of the European Union, 2016). Medical data breach can have a more
										devastating effect since aside the general impact on financial loss and reputation damage caused by other forms of
										breaches, medical data breach can also lead to depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (“PTSD”), and other
										related conditions to the individual(Kilovaty,2021) <br><br>
										
										This incident has breached the Section 2(1)(d) of the Data Protection Acts of 1988 and 2003, as AGS failed to employ
										appropriate security measures to ensure the safe storage of the couples sensitive personal data which was contained in
										the evidence file as reported by the couple. The AGS has failed in its duty to ensure confidentiality and Integrity of
										personal data. <br><br>
										
										The Commissioner determined that AGS, as a data controller, has infringed Section 2(1)(d) of the Data Protection Acts
										1988 and 2003, as it failed to take appropriate security measures to ensure the safe storage of the complainants’
										sensitive personal data which was contained on the evidence file in question. <br><br>
										
										Article 32 of the UK GDPR noted that: The controller and the processor shall implement appropriate technical and
										organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including inter alia as
										appropriate:(a)the pseudonymisation and encryption of personal data;(b)the ability to ensure the ongoing
										confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems and services;(c)the ability to restore the
										availability and access to personal data in a timely manner in the event of a physical or technical incident;(d)a
										process for regularly testing, assessing and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organisational measures for
										ensuring the security of the processing(Legislation.gov.uk, 2016) <br><br>
										
										In this case however, investigation revealed that the file got missing while in the possession of the investigating
										officer, who was instructed by a superior to update the couple about the criminal complain, and to then return the file
										to the District Office for filing. The investigating officer was disciplined and sanctioned for this contravention. <br><br>
										
										The necessary steps that needs to be done to mitigate this kind of breach involves employment of a Data protection
										Officer who will be directly liable to personal data, monitor internal compliance to data protection policies, inform
										and advise on data protection requirements, provide advice regarding Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) and act
										as a contact point for data subjects(information Commissioner's Office, 2019). Adopt the data protection by design and
										by default policy. This ensures that data protection policies are integrated into the processing activities and general
										business practices, from the design stage right through the business life-cycle(information Commissioner's Office,
										2019). Mandatory and routing employee engagement on data processing and protection training to promote a habit of data
										accountability among staff is also recommended (www.nsi.it., 2021)

										<strong>Peer Response</strong><br><br>
										<strong>Post by Elizabeth Cook</strong><br>
										Hi Jurbe <br>
										
										
										
			
										Thank you for your post, when it comes to article 32 of GDPR mandating that the data controller and processor shall
										‘implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security’ (GDPR, 2018) it raises the
										question what is an appropriate level of security? Although it is not explicitly called out in the case study, it can be
										assumed that the file they are referring to is a paper file. This immediately causes a problem as technical controls
										such as encryption cannot be enforced, access control measures cannot be used (Senor et al, 2012) and instead physical
										security measures must be relied upon. With paper records there is no way of knowing whether a lost record has been
										breached or not, if the record was digital on a mobile device it could be protected by cryptography or be remote wiped
										before an attacker can gain access to the information (Le et al, 2018), unfortunately with paper records this is not
										possible. <br><br>
										
										
										
										
										If having paper records is the only way to conduct this evidence review, there also needs to be appropriate
										organisational measures (GDPR, 2018) such as an audit process to sign in and out the evidence materials therefore
										helping to pinpoint when exactly the information may have gone missing or who was responsible. Based on this I would
										agree with the commissioner that neither appropriate technical or organisational measures had been put in place to
										protect the sensitive information in the file. <br><br>

										<strong>Reply to Elizabeth Cook</strong><br><br>
										Hi Elizabeth, <br><br>
										
										That was insightful. As you rightly mentioned, if the record was digital on a mobile device, it could be protected by
										cryptography. This would have demonstrated that appropriate technical measure was implemented against the loss of
										personal data. Information commissioners Office justifies that where it can be demonstrated that the security measures
										have rendered the data unintelligible in the event of a breach, there will be no need to report the incidence(ICO,
										2019). I believe that the appropriate level of security in this case, is the use of Cryptography solutions with the
										Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm(Mutune, 2021) <br><br>

										<strong>Summary Post</strong><br><br>
										This discussion presented several data breach scenarios with the aim of analysing real time data breaches, identifying
										how these breaches occurred and the Data Protection commissioner’s role in resolving these breaches. <br><br>
										
										The case study I chose involved a missing Evidence file belonging to a couple, that was collected and stored by the An
										Garda Síochána while investigating a case for these couples. The Evidence file got missing while in the custody of the
										An Garda Síochána and the matter was presented to the information commissioner for resolution (Data Protection
										Commission, 2020) <br><br>
										
										An Garda Síochána breached the Article 32 of the UK GDPR which requires Data Controllers and Data Processors to
										implement technical and organizational measures that ensure a level of data security appropriate for the level of risk
										presented by processing personal data ((Legislation.gov.uk, 2016) <br><br>
										
										In response to my submission, Elizabeth Cook highlighted the challenge with none electronic forms of data which cannot
										be protected by Encryption and access controls. Cook also advised that a control measure such as an audit process to
										sign in and out the evidence materials should be enforced to avoid a repeat of this type of data breach (Cook, 2022) <br><br>
										
										Data breaches are happening at an alarming rate following the increasing awareness among cyber criminals of the value of
										personal data. The issue with this missing Evidence may lead to the couple loosing their case, and worse still, it may
										also lead to other traumatic effects on the couples should the data fall in the hands of cyber criminals. The far
										reaching implication of this type of breach calls for all possible means of data protection methods to be employed and
										appropriate review of these methods to be carried out periodically. <br><br>
