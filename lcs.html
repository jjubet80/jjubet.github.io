				</header>
				<h3 id="top">Unit 1: Introduction to Cyber Security</h3>
				<p>This unit was an introduction to computing and Cyber security. I was introduced to the types of networks, types of software, and databases; The internet and the World Wide Web and how it works through the lecture notes on the module. This was quite refreshing as i realised there were so many things I have learned in the past that I have almost completely forgotten. The CIA triangle and networking basics where some areas I was quite familiar with in the past and learning them again encouraged me and made me eager to learn more The first discussion forum was on why Cyber security is now a global issue and why it is important for companies to invest in Cyber Security. This discussion was quite spontaneous with so many intelligent submissions by my colleagues. It was a reminder to the reason we were studying cyber security in the first place. I see the discussion forum as a practical and more realistic form of learning. It exposed me to research methods and created awareness on the importance of Cyber security. I learned a great deal from my colleagues and I would recommend more of such discussion forums as a better way of impacting knowledge</p>
				<h3 id="unit2">Unit 2: Cyber security issues and their implications for businesses</h3>
				<p>This unit introduced me to the first case study on cyber security. The discussion on SHELL as a case study made me
				realise the global impact of cyber security. This is a multinational company with several branches across the globe that
				is connected via the internet. The implication of a data breach across any of their networks will result in consequences
				like breach of the Data protection policies, reputational damage, and loss of income. In my opinion, the company should
				invest more in cyber security because this is not only about protecting their assets, but also about compliance to
				regulations The seminar questions that needed to be answered were: • Investigate the various security concerns this
				company has had, and might have in the future • Provide exemplars of how these concerns have been or can be dealt with
				by the company. How have other multi-national organisations mitigated such issues? • Based on this example, what issues
				do you foresee as a Cyber Security professional if employed by multinational companies? How does this compare with
				issues faced by small and medium-sized companies? • We will also discuss various Cyber Security roles during this
				seminar. Have you reviewed potential roles to take up during/after this course? If so, why have you chosen a particular
				role? These questions were answered during the seminar and it was identified that the company will have more security
				challenges in terms of scale because of its large coverage (found in more than 70 countries) and digitisation
				technologies. The company could be exposed to malware attacks, insider attacks and privacy issues because of legacy
				systems, delay in updates and patches, database systems management. The solutions to these issues lies in the CIA
				triangle(Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability). By doing so, they need to abide by different country jurisditions
				laws and rules and applying it to IT infrastructure, conform to GDPR rules, invest in good Cyber security Technology,
				train their staff on security breaches, regular data monitoring, embrace cloud technologies. The security solutions
				should be across, network security, software security and human factors. The company will require specialist in most
				field of cyber security and If I were to work with one, I will prefer the security Architect. I like to find solutions
				to issues. I play chess a lot and I am in most times at the defence side. Always calculating my opponent’s moves and
				preparing myself against those moves. This I believe is a skill needed for the Security Architect role The unit also
				covered the collaborative discussion 1, which is covered in the Artefact section of this module</p>
				<h3 id="unit3">Unit 3: Approaches to Cyber Security design</h3>
				<p>This unit covered the approaches to cyber security design. A lecture case was presented which discussed the psychology
				of cyber security where attackers use the human psychology with attacks such as pretexting, phishing etc. lecture
				discussed the UK national cyber security center principles for secured system design and focused on secured approaches
				to Network and software design. The lecture noted thread identification methods like STRIDE, Abuse cases, Attack trees
				and protection, OSWAP top 10 web application security risk and their secured security measures. The lessons presented
				more professional details in the aspect cyber security exposing us to the idea of identifying various forms of security
				threats and finding solutions to these threats especially, understanding that threats are also evolving. In my Opinion,
				this unit is a very important unit in the sense that it is an introduction to the core cyber security issues and
				understanding this aspect will determine the way I will understand this course as a whole. So far, the concept is quite
				clear and I understand that cyber security design approach is Earn or give, but never assume trust, Use an
				authentication mechanism that cannot be compromised, Authorise after you authenticate, Ensure all data are explicitly
				validated, Use cryptography correctly, Identify sensitive data and mechanism to handle, Users must always be considered,
				Understand the effects of changes to integrating external components and attack surface, Flexibility is required when
				changing objects and actors and Separating data and control instructions; never process control instructions received
				from untrusted sources.</p>
				<h3 id="unit4">Unit 4: Threat identification and modelling</h3>
				<p>This Unit focused on an example of web-based information system where potential threats were identified using threat
				modelling techniques. Questions below were asked; • Review 3 threat modelling techniques that you have found are more
				commonly used in any industry of your choice • In deciding what techniques to apply, what considerations need to be made
				to professional, legal, social and ethical concerns? A seminar was presented on Picture Archiving Communications System
				(PACS) information system to address these questions The PACS system is a method of accessing medical information
				electronically in picture form and storing this data. The system mimics the manual file systems in hospitals for the
				radiology departments. In securing such a system, the CIA triangle will be considered and tips to adopt is ensuring no
				blind spots in the design, penetration must be difficult with minimal attack surfaces, system resilience should be
				considered, have ability to detect suspicious or attack activities in real time The Abuse case threat modelling
				identified 2 major actors. The Malicious staff who may want to delete patient data, or a cyber criminal who may want to
				use the brute force to acquire admin password. The attack tree threat modelling identifies the ultimate goal of the
				cyber criminal and ways to achieve this goal in form of a tree. Protection trees are also drafted in the same pattern
				identifying measure to protect against such threats. The STRIDE method is identifying spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation,
				Information disclosure, Denial of service and Elevation of privilege With threats aiming at Authentication, changing
				content of database, clearing activity logs, access to vital or restricted information, disrupting system availability
				and authorisation. The threats should be assessed to determine their impact either high, medium or low and identify
				matching security approach These Topics have exposed me to the different attack patterns and models use to analyse them.
				The concept of STRIDE and attack trees is however more appealing to me. STRIDE gives me an impression of a simple but
				yet complete approach. Implementation becomes easier once these threats have been identified. The Attack tree also gives
				an impression of a sequential and hierarchical approach and like working through a mess of cybercrime incidences</p>
				<h3 id="unit5">Unit 5: Object-oriented Analysis, Design and Programming Techniques for Secure Systems</h3>
				<p>This unit focused on object-oriented programming and the key terms associated with it as it relates to securing our
				systems from the design stage to implementation. The key terms discussed are objects, classes, object-oriented analysis,
				object-oriented design, object-oriented programming, data, behaviours, methods, relationships, multiplicity of objects,
				and Unified Modelling Language (UML). All the terms were properly defined and explained. Examples of UML use cases were
				discussed using fruits and that made the understanding easier. UML associations were illustrated with clear examples
				like oranges belonging to backets. The UML class diagram showing the showing the key terms and how they relate with each
				other was demonstrated and that consolidated the understanding. The various diagrams associated with UML were discussed
				and examples and used cases provided. There are three types of diagrams discussed in this unit as it relates to UML and
				they include use case diagram, class diagram and sequence diagram. Security design implementation using UML was
				extensively discussed. A use case diagram in UML is graphical representation off all the possibilities of how the users
				interact with the system. It is illustrated with a diagram below The class diagram is basically used to describe the
				static structure of the system as illustrated in the diagram below. The sequence diagram is used to describe the dynamic
				behaviour between objects in the system, it shows how a group of objects can work together. This is illustrated with the
				diagram below. Programs and Programming Languages were also introduced and the reasons while we need them were discussed
				extensively and one of the major reason is the performing of repetitive task and this will enhance the efficiency and
				accuracy of the task been performed. The unit was concluded by showing examples of programming using python programming
				language, the naming conventions and functions used when programming with python. <br>

				<h3 id="unit6">Unit 6: Application of UML to Secure Software Design</h3>
				<p>This unit focus was on using UML tools to design security requirements for software designs. Different Software data
				structures were deeply considered, and their behaviour critically investigated.. Every software comes with several
				components that add together to make a solution. There are associated threats with each of these components. UML data
				modelling technique was used to identify the following dataflow, storage, and security issues as it relates to software
				design. A seminar preparatory question was asked; • Try developing a UML diagram using the Visual Paradigm tool to model
				at least two of the designs discussed in the seminar To try this, Abuse Case was developed using the ATM as Example <br>
				<strong>Figure 6: Abuse case using the ATM as example</strong><br>
				<img src="assets/images/3_abuse.jpg" alt="Abuse case using the ATM as example">
			</p>
				
				<p>The seminar presentation further explained that UML diagram is not a programing language but rather a modelling language
				use to model object oriented complex system A used case diagram defines an Actor who has a role, as shown in the
				illustration above. The Actor in the above illustration is the customer, cyber criminal or the malicious staff The use
				case is a functionality of the system. The illustration above is a Use case for an Automated teller machine showing the
				functions that can be accessed. Withdrawals balance check etc UML diagrams can be used to model a change in state of a
				system from the Initial state, the transaction state also showing the event that happened and then the state or
				conditions at a point in time Other diagrams with examples were illustrated. The Class diagram and Sequence diagram for
				an online shopping system was illustrated. The PACS system(Picture Archiving and communication system) was taken as a
				case study and the class diagram, use case, Abuse case, sequence diagrams were developed and presented with emphasis on
				how to implement security measures in these models. The collaborative discussion 2 also started in this Unit. The
				collaborative discussion topic: • Identify and discuss two security technologies and the context in which they can be
				employed. Your discussion could consider either network or/and software security issues. For example, if a network
				issue, what type of firewall would be ideal for the solution? What are the strengths and weaknesses of the solution? The
				security solutions I discussed were Network Access Control (NAC) and the Firewall Details for this discussions are found
				in the Artefacts for Unit 6. Follow link for details for this collaborative discussion I presented an outline for my
				individual Essay and details is captured in the Artefact section for this Unit</p>
				<h3 id="unit7">Unit 7: Database Design and Implementation</h3>
				<p>The unit started with a Lecture cast on Database systems. One of the key components of information management system was
				object of focus in this unit. The database is a very critical part of any application. Its design and implementation
				with focus on security implications were exhaustively discussed. Concepts and principles of database design was
				thoroughly explained. Data management and the role that data plays in any and every organization was highlighted.
				Tracking business activities and generating information which can be analysed for insightful action for improve business
				profitability was discussed as some of the uses of database in modern business operations. Database, Database system,
				Database management system (DBMS), data entities, attributes and keys were all explained. DBMS is a software used to
				build, manage, and manipulate a database. The two approaches to data management are traditional approach and database
				approach and were extensively discussed. Data redundancy and data integrity are the major challenges associated with the
				traditional approach although it might tend to work very well with smaller task. Data maintenance might be very
				difficult to achieve. The alternative is the database approach with several benefits such as controlled data redundancy
				which makes maintenance easy and increases flexibility of the data. It makes data sharing easy but requires a database
				management system to be able to effectively implement it. Three database models were considered, and they include the
				Hierarchical model, Network model and Relational model. The relational model is the most intuitive to implement and
				hence its wide usage in application. The major database design considerations that were discussed are type of content,
				nature of access to be granted, logical structure of the database as well as the physical organization. Entity
				Relationship Diagrams (ERD) and their uses were properly explained. Examples were provided to aid my understanding. The
				Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERD) deals with the logical aspect of a database design as an abstract model of how a
				database is structured to meet requirements. It identifies the relationship between data items. A database manipulation
				programming language called Structural Query Language (SQL) which was developed in 1970s was introduced as programming
				language for standardizing database operations and manipulations. Database security as a major part of cyber security
				was highlighted and this involves preserving database confidentiality, integrity, and availability and database
				protection tools major functionalities must include discovery, data activity monitoring, encryption and tokenisation,
				data security optimization and risk analysis. The unit concluded by introducing emerging trends in databases which
				include distributed databases, object-oriented databases, image database, Hypertext database, Hypermedia database, Graph
				database The collaborative discussion forum 2 continued in this unit. We are mandated to respond to at least three of
				our peers' contributions from the Unit 6 Collaborative Learning Discussion. My response to the discussion is also found
				in the Artefact section for this Unit A formative Activity was also introduced on Phyton programming. We were tasked to
				get familiar with Python programming by working through the Learning Python exercises in Codio in preparation for week
				8's seminar. Basic skills like Operators, Conditionals, Loops was practiced on Codio IDE</p>
				<h3 id="unit8">Unit 8: Introduction to Python programming and MySQL</h3>
				<p>This unit is basically about programing. It is a follow up on the previous Unit and delves more into the programing
				language. A seminar was presented on Python and MySQL. Python is a high-level scripting language that has support for
				object-oriented programming with dynamic semantics and used for general purpose programming. It was developed in 1989 It
				is very easy to read, learn and maintain. It is portable across multiple operating systems, while having support for
				several open source and commercial Integrated Development Environment (IDE).</p>
				<blockquote>Examples given for python scripts were<br>
				• Output and Print statement;<br>
				>>myString = “Hello World”<br>
				>>print(myString)<br>
				• >>user = raw_input(“enter login name”)<br>
				Enter Login name:root<br>
				>>Print(“Your login is, “user</blockquote>
				<blockquote>It has support for seven mathematical operators and they include<br>
				S/n&nbsp; Operator Sign&nbsp; Operator Name&nbsp; Use case&nbsp; Description<br>
				1&nbsp;&nbsp; +&nbsp;&nbsp; Addition&nbsp;&nbsp; 5 + 6 = 11&nbsp;&nbsp; Adds two operands<br>
				2&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; Subtraction&nbsp;&nbsp; 12 – 9 = 3&nbsp;&nbsp; Subtract two operands<br>

				7&nbsp;&nbsp; **&nbsp;&nbsp; Exponential&nbsp;&nbsp; 3**2 = 9&nbsp;&nbsp; Returns first number raised to power of second number</blockquote>
				<p>This unit is basically about programing. It is a follow up on the previous Unit and delves more into the programing
				language. A seminar was presented on Python and MySQL. Python is a high-level scripting language that has support for
				object-oriented programming with dynamic semantics and used for general purpose programming. It was developed in 1989 It
				is very easy to read, learn and maintain. It is portable across multiple operating systems, while having support for
				several open source and commercial Integrated Development Environment (IDE).</p>
				<p>Python variables and statements are case sensitive while types are assigned during initialisation and equal sign (=) is
				used for assignment while it has no support for pre-declaration on variables. It has support for the following number
				formats: integers, Boolean, Float, Complex and Decimal. It uses single and double quotation marks in strings and other
				use cases. Python has support for the following data structures: List, Dictionary, Tuple and Set. Iteration and
				conditionals are an integral part of python operations. It has support for custom made functions and can open, read, and
				write to files. One of python main feature is support for Object-oriented programming where classes serve as container
				for related data and logic. They create objects called instances and may have attributes and methods. Modules are used
				to extend the functionality of python and it is a logical way to physically arrange python codes in files. It may
				contain executable codes, functions, and classes. Python has a list of words called reserved words which are used in the
				way they were originally designed and intended. MySQL is an open-source Structured Query Language (SQL) based relational
				database management system. It is compatible with standard SQL and is supported by PHP, Perl, and Python among other
				programming languages. It requires the installing of MySQL server and MySQL Management workbench for accessing the
				database and tables in them. It has support for several commands and has an English like syntax. It has tons of
				shortcuts for executing a lot of commands. Tables reside in database and multiple tables can be in one database. Data
				can be extracted from different tables using the appropriate join command and syntax. Every table must have a primary
				key that uniquely identifies the records in the table. Requesting for an information from the tables that reside in a
				database is called query. The basic query must include the SELECT and WHERE clauses. The major considerations for
				database design are content, access, logical structure, and physical organization. MySQL database can be easily
				integrated with python for performing specific task. The appropriate module for connection must be imported and
				connections created and correct parameters for connections provided.</p>
				<h3 id="unit9">Unit 9: OOP Application of Principles and Concepts</h3>
				<p>This unit focussed on four key areas that will enhance security of applications. They include access control and
				privileges, integrating MySQL and Python in application, Database management with Python, and secured password and
				authentication implementation using Python scripts. The access control and account management features discussed include
				the following: it allows users the opportunity to connect to database and again access to restricted content through
				provision of their username and passwords which has been registered in the database beforehand. The host system
				authenticates users and the systems they are using to gain access and assigns the corresponding privileges associated
				with the account. The process is concluded when restricted contents are made available to the user based on privilege
				level set on their user account in the database. There is no connection whatsoever between operating system user account
				and database or application user account. The user accounts in the database are stored in the users table of the
				database while user passwords are encrypted with an encryption method specified during database design. MySQL comes with
				an initial Database Administrator account called root. They are two main categories of privileges associated with MySQL
				database and it includes administrative privileges which are global and applies to the entire server while the database
				privileges are specific to a particular database and all objects within the database. A detailed guidelines for granting
				privileges was extensively discussed and its importance highlighted. Correct syntax for implementation of basic task
				like creating user account, how to specify account names, wildcards creation and management using different Network IP
				address classes were discussed and demonstrated. Further demonstrations were done using the root account in MySQL
				database. Three encrypted connections were identified and discussed which include server side, client side and mandatory
				encryption connections, their benefits and use cases were also highlighted. Their correct syntax for their
				implementations were properly explained and demonstrated.</p>
				<h3 id="unit10">Unit 10: Secure Web development</h3>
				<p>This unit was dedicated to understanding the key concepts and principles of web applications development as modern
				businesses cannot effectively function without them. It further explored the technologies and frameworks for web
				application development. Considering merits, demerits, use cases and best practices. The main components of any web
				application are hardware, the operating system, a scripting language, a database, and a Hypertext Transfer Protocol
				(HTTP) server. They form the building blocks upon which any other activity will depend upon. The Operating System (OS)
				is responsible for resource allocations and management to the application. It also allows communication between hardware
				and software and allow users to interreact with the application and hardware. There are a lot of Operating Systems
				available today and they include Windows, Linux, Mac, Unix, Sun Solaris and many more. The HTTP Server, which is a
				software, used in web application, compiles the results from Scripting Language, Database and Hypertext Markup Language
				commonly known as HTML file to generate content for users. HTTP Server enables sharing of webpages, scripts and files
				between developers and end users. It is also responsible for tracking files that belong to server or end user’s
				computer. The HTTP server has the responsibility of presenting outputs from databases and scripting languages into HTML
				for browsers to display on end user’s computer. They are different types of browsers with varying features for the end
				users to view their HTML content. They include Google chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, Opera, and many others.
				Some examples of HTTP server are Apache and Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS). The Scripting language is
				divided into two parts, the Client-side and Server-side scripting languages. This software component of web development
				is used to express complex logical instructions and processes. The scripting programming language must support database
				and integration of internet protocols to be able to send data and messages over the network. The examples of scripting
				programming languages are Java, JavaScript, PHP, Python, Ruby, Perl, C#, C++ etc. Database is another crucial component
				of any and every web application. There are two technological options available for the implementation of databases.
				This is either by SQL or NoSQL. The most used examples of SQL-based implementation include MySQL, MariaDB, Cloud DB and
				many others while the most common NoSQL implementation is a document-oriented database called MongoDB. This is
				relatively new technology, and it is superefficient and very fast compared to the SQL-based technologies. The
				architecture of web application is another important part of the entire process that was discussed. The MVC architecture
				which has three parts was discussed and they include The Model, The View and the Controller.</p>
				<h3 id="unit11">Unit 11: Introduction to Secure Web Programming with DJango</h3>
				<p>This unit focuses on web application development using Django. It explores and implements some web application
				components using this framework. It explored technologies and libraries available to implement some of the security
				solutions discussed during the module. Django is a High level python based web development framework or software that
				makes it easy to build dynamic websites and supports the properties of common framework. Dynamic websites are sites
				whose contents are created based on each user requirement. Most frequent programming task have shortcuts on how to
				implement them using Django. It is very easy to retrieve records from a database or carry out a task based on user input
				by using Django framework. Mapping of requested URLs to code that handles requests to specify username and other
				associated parameters are normally used. HTML forms can easily be displayed, validated and redisplayed with ease by the
				use of this framework. Data type manipulation through data submitted by user is extremely ease to implement by the use
				of Django. It works with template system where content is separated from presentation and can easily integrate with
				storage layers to offer versatility to its operations. There are other popular frameworks for web developments and they
				include Smarty, Yii framework, Zend framework. Django encourages loose coupling approach in its implementation and
				emphasis that applications should communicate to each other by the use of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). Its
				main properties are Template, Database access system, HTTP request/response layer, Caching and also has support for the
				Model View Controller (MVC) architecture. Where Model defines Database and update data items, View defines user
				interface and Controller defines business logic. The major issues with traditional frameworks were highlighted and
				discussed and the need to embrace Django explained. Some of the issues are where to keep your code and the security
				implication of the decision. Keeping your code somewhere that is personal to you provides additional layer of security
				unlike in traditional framework where codes are kept in the root directory which is known to all. Python 2.3 or higher
				version is requirement for Django to operate unhindered.</p>
				<h3 id="unit12">Unit 12: A Look into the Future of Cyber Security</h3>
				<p>This unit examines in details all the various topics covered in the module and tries to take a gaze at the future of
				Cyber Security. It explored Cyber Security areas which provide you with some perspective about the various career
				options that are available in this field of Cyber Security. Trends and specialised knowledge that are required of Cyber
				Security professional were also pointed out in this unit. The impact of emerging technologies on Cyber Security were
				extensively addressed while privacy and data confidentiality implications on these emerging technologies were also
				examined. The first emerging technology discussed is The Internet of Things (IoT) and this is revolutionising almost
				every aspect of the society and, by extension, industries. As the fifth-generation (5G) networks become more readily
				accessible across many countries and continents of the world, the growth is going to be exponential as more devices and
				services get connected, there are over 50 billion devices that have connected and many more are connecting on daily
				basis. The Internet of Everything (IoE) seeks to describe the fact that it is not only devices that are connected but,
				connection now includes people, processes, data and things and this goes to show that all things are now interconnected.
				A step further by the IoE is the Internet of Nano Things (loNT). Here, nano-sensors are being incorporated in diverse
				objects and through the use of nano-networks. The second emerging technology discussed is Cloud Computing and
				Manufacturing, The main idea behind Cloud computing is to provide on-demand computing services with high reliability,
				scalability and availability in a distributed environment.In Cloud computing, everything is treated as a service (EaaS,
				XaaS, *aaS), which may include Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure as a
				Service (IaaS) and many more. PayPal services was used as an excellent example to illustrate software as a service.
				Companies focus on other areas of their operation while utilizing PayPal to manage their payment services. Companies
				like Facebook, Google AppEngine, and Amazon EC2 are some of the common examples of PaaS. This allows users or businesses
				to use those platforms to carry out business activities without incurring any cost or knowing the internal workings of
				those systems. While Microsoft Azure is an excellent example of Infrastructure as a service (IaaS). You get all features
				of an enterprise server and many more in using Microsoft Azure. The payment for everything as a Service is normally pay
				as you Go (PAYG) Edge computing is the third emerging technology from the internet evolution that was discussed. It was
				designed to collect data from traditional database setups, sensor devices as well as mobile devices. Unlike cloud
				computing (where the data is processed by a cloud service), edge computing allows processing to be carried out at the
				network edge so that processing (including the devices and where the data is collected) is secure. There are several
				places that Edge computing can be applied due to its speed of execution and security. It can be used in finding a
				missing child by deploying data to the edge devices for the search to be done locally. Security threats have increased
				due to the fact that devices have become part of the Internet of Things which enables the storage, analysis, monitoring,
				and sharing of vast quantities of data with other networked devices and users. Evolution has added another security
				risks that device manufacturers and application developers never anticipated and therefore there is an urgent need for
				cyber security experts to up their game to adequately respond to these new security challenges. This is because many
				devices now have to be configured to function in an environment where they were not originally designed to be used and
				the privacy of users’ is threatened because of their limited control and choice over the collection, retention, and
				distribution of their data.’ Despite the fact that there are a lot of security tools out there, the demand for smart
				security tools and methods will increase to be able to keep up with the security threats discussed as result of the
				technological evolution. Artificial Intelligence (AI) will be a handy tool in responding to the security challenges been
				discovered through evolution of technology. By training a cyber-security bot with deep learning, an AI could be made
				that scans for and predicts or detects threats nearly perfectly and hence offering a better protection. Finally, it is
				important to develop positive security culture in organizations, and this area of research focuses on security risk
				protocols that can be applied across various settings and jurisdictions. To achieve an excellent and effective security
				solution, all parties and participants must be involved and play the game by all stipulated rules of engagement.</p>
